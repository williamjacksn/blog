> I sit by the dimming firelight  
> and watch the flames dance  
> over the white-hot ashes,  
> and hear the soft crack  
> of the burning wood.  
> I think:  
> Who sat here many years before?  
> Was this the Great Circle where the Natives would dance?  
> I see the never-ending movement of the arms and feet,  
> Dancers adorned with rainbows,  
> hopping from one foot to the other.  
> I hear the relentless beating of the drum,  
> the heart of the Dance,  
> and the chants and cries of all who watch.  
> I feel the ground tremble from the Dancers,  
> and the drums,  
> and people cheering them on,  
> and as the Dance continues  
> its sole purpose identifies itself  
> as the Rain begins to drop from the heavens to the waiting Earth.  
> The Dancers&#x02bc; outstretched arms meet the Rain. They stop,  
> their purpose fulfilled.  
> All cheer and run to shelter.  
> I sit by the dimming firelight,  
> as the sparks take flight,  
> as if to run from the heaven-sent blessing of Rain,  
> and I see that I am here and they are there,  
> yet they live on  
> in the Rain.
