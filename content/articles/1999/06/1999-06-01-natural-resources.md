I am convinced that at least one third of the world&#x02bc;s water supply iswasted each day in the simple act of brushing one&#x02bc;s teeth. Do you knowanyone who actually turns off the faucet when they are brushing? I don&#x02bc;t.I believe I have the answer to this worldwide dilemma: stop brushing. Nowdon&#x02bc;t get me wrong, I brush my teeth at least once a day, more if needed.But think about it. If no one brushed their teeth, halitosis wouldn&#x02bc;t bedisease. Everyone would have it! There would be something wrong with you if youhad minty fresh breath. You would be jailed for violating Water ConservationCode (WCC) 3538: excess use of water for dental hygiene.

Take case scenario one: The ancient ancients that lived in and around Pompeiigot fossilized in no time flat due to the roll of Nature&#x02bc;s dice, right?Look at it again. When examined to find more about the lost culture, scientists,archaeologists, and what have you found that almost every corpse — no,every corpse — had a perfect dental record. No tooth decay whatsoever! Nowisn&#x02bc;t it logical to believe that, because they used so much water onsomething as trivial as hygiene, Mother Nature&#x02bc;s courier informed her ofa problem? Therefore, following a logical sequence of events, old Ma Naturecaused Pompeii, a volcano that had been dormant for centuries, to suddenly eruptwithout warning, spewing its hot lava and ash all over the beautifulcountryside, not to mention the bustling cities and tranquil towns. This singleact of Nature Anger, if you will, completely eradicated the civilization, andsaved the water supply for today&#x02bc;s needs.

You could take this as a warning, or maybe a slap on the wrist with a wetnoodle, but don&#x02bc;t take it lightly. It is quite possible that any type ofnatural phenomena could wipe out America as we know it. The tragedy in OklahomaCity was, well, a tragedy. But how much water do you suppose they were usingeach and every day? You needn&#x02bc;t worry. I&#x02bc;m sure my family ofeleven children uses as much water as a small East European country per day, sowe would be the first to go. And, if appearance and what others think about youcomes first in your life, by all means, keep on brushing, and go ahead, take aslong as your favorite song on the radio. And if you feel like it, let the waterflow the whole time. __Just let it flow!__
