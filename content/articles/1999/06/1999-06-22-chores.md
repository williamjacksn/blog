Everybody has them. Everybody does them. Everybody hates them. If you don&#x02bc;t, we need to speak privately. Yes, I
am speaking of chores, those wonderful things parents use to occupy you. There are daily chores, as (almost) everyone
knows, and there are &ldquo;special&rdquo; chores. First come the daily chores.

As you may already know, I am a member of a family of eleven children. One is out of the house at this writing, but that
doesn&#x02bc;t change much at home. Even if all the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; chores are assigned, everyone must have
something to do. Therefore, this week, I am assigned the following chore: &ldquo;Wash by hand all the dishes that are
too large to fit in the dishwasher.&rdquo; You may immediately think, as I did, &ldquo;What kind of chore is that? Who
thought _that_ up?&rdquo; I asked my mother those very questions. Of course, I didn&#x02bc;t ask her in that particular
tone. I want to live to see my next birthday, you see. I asked politely, &ldquo;Was this chore your idea? Is it really
necessary?&rdquo;

Her immediate reply was, &ldquo;If you are going to complain about your job, then I&#x02bc;m going to take away
points!&rdquo;

A brief explanation of &ldquo;points&rdquo;. We get &ldquo;points&rdquo; when we do our chores and other extra things
around the house. At the end of the week, we can &ldquo;buy&rdquo; items with our points. Of course, all the items are
outrageously priced, so you have to work your fingers off to buy a &ldquo;fun-sized&rdquo; candy bar. Now that I
mentioned it, one-bite-and-it&#x02bc;s-gone is not my idea of &ldquo;fun-sized&rdquo;. Back to the subject, I really
don&#x02bc;t care for points, so I just do my job whenever I feel like it, or when Mother makes me. I&#x02bc;ve gotten
to where I am indifferent to washing dishes now. Is that good or bad?

Now on to &ldquo;special&rdquo; chores. Evidently, when you are offered a &ldquo;special&rdquo; chore, it is the
equivalent of your guardian saying, &ldquo;You&#x02bc;re going to do this whether you like it or not, even though
it&#x02bc;s not part of your regular chore schedule (pronounced &lsquo;shed-yule&rsquo;).&rdquo; As you can see,
chore-givers try to use psychology to trick you into wanting to do chores (for a shallow look at psychology, please see
[Turtle&#x02bc;s Thoughts&trade; on Threats][a]).
