I almost hit a skunk once. It was just sauntering across the road, not thinking of any dire consequences. I had to slow down almost five miles per hour under the speed limit. Aren&#x02bc;t there laws against that? Aren&#x02bc;t there designated &ldquo;Skunk Crossings&rdquo;? They have them for deer, moose, ducks, and small children. Why not skunks?

I have just been informed that when you see a sign that reads &ldquo;Speed Limit: 30 mph&rdquo;, it really means &ldquo;Speed Limit: 30 mph, except when going up a hill&rdquo;. I haven&#x02bc;t lived in this hilly country all my life, so I was unaware of this obscure traffic rule. Are there any others I need to know about? Tell me, please!

A friend of mine told me about the &ldquo;hill rule&rdquo; one morning on the school bus. Laugh if you will, I am a senior and I ride the school bus. I practically wear a sign that reads &ldquo;No transportation and _proud_!&rdquo;. Besides, this is my chance to &ldquo;preside&rdquo; over the bus. I&#x02bc;m in my high school prime! The privileges are just rolling in!

Anyway, as I understand it, when you get to the bottom of a respectably large hill, you should &ldquo;punch it&rdquo; regardless of any posted speed limit sign. I believe this behavior is already observable in today&#x02bc;s society. Just take a walk down to your local hill, and see for yourself. I recommend it!

Signed, Turtle. Once before and once again.
