It&#x02bc;s morning. I&#x02bc;m still in the air. I looked out the window and was reminded of Lehi&#x02bc;s journey across the many waters.

>  
> His first time to cross the many waters;  
> His first time to fly across the sea;  
> A journey to a distant land,  
> He put himself into God&#x02bc;s handSo he could be all God wants him to be.

There is a thick layer of clouds under us. It looks like we are flying over a polar ice cap.

>  
> Though he feels the smallest of all God&#x02bc;s creationIn his mind and in his heart he knows the truth.  
> A call from the Divine had come;  
> He knows that he must leave his home  
> And spread God&#x02bc;s word abroad while in his youth.
> 
>  
> The sun will rise, the sun will set; a day will pass.  
> Yet if just one soul knows more than what he did the last  
> The journey was worthwhile.  
> The Son has ris&#x02bc;n, the Son has come; He&#x02bc;ll come again.In His eyes He wants each soul to be His friend.  
> Let&#x02bc;s go the extra mile.

Sunrise. Inspiration. Call it what you will, its beauty will always exceed my expectations.
