I&#x02bc;m on the downhill slide toward Spring Break, and I&#x02bc;m loving every minute of it. I only have one class on Friday. French was cancelled. I had a big test in Computer Science on Wednesday, so I doubt there will be many students in class Friday.

I am ready to go home! I&#x02bc;ve never felt more ready to get out of Austin and into Waco, of all places, &hellip; and the next time I&#x02bc;m in Austin, I&#x02bc;ll be 22. Think about that.
