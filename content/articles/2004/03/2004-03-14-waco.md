As you can see, I made it safely to the old home-town scene. I&#x02bc;m loving every minute of being home. My family is the best family in the world. My friends are the best friends in the world. My life is so great. I can&#x02bc;t complain.

My mom has succesfully booked me solid for the coming week, with plenty of fun-like activities. I also get to do yard work. How cool is that? I don&#x02bc;t even _have_ a yard in Austin, much less am I able to _work_ on one.

Can you tell I&#x02bc;m excited? Good.
