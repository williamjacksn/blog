Today marks the end of my Spring Break holiday. What a welcome break it has been. I take back that part about yard work being fun. Working in someone else&#x02bc;s yard is fun. Working in one&#x02bc;s own yard may not necessarily be so. Still, the satisfaction of a job well done is always a genuine motivation ex post facto.

In the long run, I suppose I accomplished plenty of nothing and a bit of something over the workless week. I went to Dallas twice (Thursday and Saturday) to visit [the temple](http://www.lds.org/church/temples/dallas-texas), first with my parents and then with my brother and sister. That is where the real peace and quiet was to be found.

I also endured a fun-filled birthday celebration as I turned 22 on Wednesday. Thanks to Amber for the (hopefully) truth-defying &ldquo;My GPA Sucks&rdquo; shirt. Thanks to Mary for the mug of green gingham (and/or check).
