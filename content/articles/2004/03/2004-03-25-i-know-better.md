I&#x02bc;m up late again. Or shall I say early? I got to talking to a friend about some Java programming for a class, and he gave me some ideas about how to get the program done. So I up and coded for another hour or two.

Then another friend came online and I&#x02bc;ve been chatting away ever since. That&#x02bc;s my weakness: friends. Contact. Communication. I&#x02bc;ll stay up all night if I have someone to talk to. That&#x02bc;s what I did the night before my birthday last week.

I may be more tired than sled dogs the next morning, but I don&#x02bc;t ever regret it. Time spent with friends is never wasted.

Time spent programming, however, might be. Wasted, that is.
