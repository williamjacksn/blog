Everyone in the Central Texas area should come see [Texas Revue](http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/txrevue/txrevue04/). This awesome variety/talent show is beyond awesome. Beyond, I tell you.

Student organizations from all over the UT campus auditioned acts for the show. Word is, out of the 64 acts that auditioned, only 14 made it into the show. We&#x02bc;re talking cream of the crop here: no disappointments at this shindig.

Acts are diverse; from singing to dancing to skits, Texas Revue has it all. There _will_ be something for you to enjoy.

And in case I forgot to mention, it&#x02bc;s free!
