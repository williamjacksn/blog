A hug is a rather interesting form of communication. It reflects a different attitude towards a person than a kiss. It can&#x02bc;t be compared to a handshake. All these types of contact speak different ideas.

You can say just about anything with a hug. &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; is probably the most prolific genre of hug given. Then there&#x02bc;s &ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; &ldquo;I was so worried,&rdquo; and a personal favorite of mine, &ldquo;What up my brotha (sic)!&rdquo;

You could even feign friendship with a hug to a &ldquo;long time-no see (but not long enough)&rdquo; type acquaintance. It&#x02bc;s disgustingly low and highly disgusting, but nevertheless can be done.

Depending on how you look at them, hugs can be the only way to express true feelings, or the only way to avoid expressing true feelings. A hug _is_ a rather interesting form of communication.

So which meant hug, the &ldquo;x&rdquo; or the &ldquo;o&rdquo;?
