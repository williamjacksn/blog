Today I read:

>  
> And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you. (3 Nephi 20:22, The Book of Mormon)

Did you guess the speaker? Can you imagine what it would be like that day? Can you wait? The one thing that this verse made clear to me &mdash; and I thought I already knew it (you know how that is) &mdash; was that Jesus Christ _is_ the powers of heaven! I know, it sounds obvious now, but when you read it for the first time and the Holy Ghost says, &ldquo;Hey, bub, are you paying attention here?&rdquo; it&#x02bc;s a special moment. I&#x02bc;m glad I could share it with someone.
