Someone has invented a device that takes an ordinary person and transforms him or her into a fool, usually in the midst of this person&#x02bc;s close friends. The device has been known to backfire, though, and turn a person &ldquo;cool&rdquo;.

The device: Dance Dance Revolution for PlayStation 2.

Let&#x02bc;s just say the coolness may not be so subtle anymore.
