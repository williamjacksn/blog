I am obsessive-compulsive. I have been so all along. I figured it out a few days ago. No one even told me. I came up with it all by myself.

*   I am an infophile. I stockpile information. I arrange and rearrange, sort and stack, archive and organize, and I never stop. Never. Because I can&#x02bc;t. Because it&#x02bc;s a disorder. Those are the things you can&#x02bc;t stop.
*   I am a perfectionist with things that will never be perfect. This website, for example. It&#x02bc;s never just right. I&#x02bc;m always tweaking the style. Always.

And now I have to go work out.
