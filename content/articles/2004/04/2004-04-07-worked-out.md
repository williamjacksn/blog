And I did go work out, and boy are my legs tired. That must have been the first real workout in a real workout room with real workout equipment in a few years.

It reminds me of my senior year in high school, when I &hellip; _fade into white &hellip; cue psychedelic flashback music &hellip;_

When my senior year of high school rolled around, I still lacked a full year of athletic credit to graduate. I was forced (yes, forced) to take a P.E. class all year. I signed up for a class called &ldquo;Applications of Personal Fitness&rdquo;. That sounded like a normal &ldquo;team sports&rdquo; kinda class to me, but much to my surprise &hellip;

___Powerlifting!___ and I couldn&#x02bc;t have been more depressed. I thought my life was over. I was easily the weakest man (boy?) in there, and if any one of those brutes had it in for me I wouldn&#x02bc;t have lasted two sets of four reps.

To spoil a long story, it turned out to be the most rewarding and fun year of my life to that point. My self esteem improved more than my bench press, and I _was_ the most improved lifter in the class, even though I was still lifting the least out of everyone.

There is a moral to this story. Points to she who guesses it.
