title: What a Waste of Time

Time waits for no man, not even me, as I sit at my computer, organizing, reorganizing, listening to music, typing here and there, sipping FlavorAid (which could use a little flavor aid, if you know what I mean).

Which I have been doing for that last five hours straight.

No, that&#x02bc;s not true. I got up to do my laundry, then to put my laundry in the dryer, then to cook dinner, then to eat dinner.

Well, I did accomplish the eating phase while at the computer. There&#x02bc;s one word for me: junkie.

And by the way, if you were expecting a poem-a-day or something, just keep on expecting and the likelihood of such an event might increase.
