This is the first remote post I have ever remotely posted. I&#x02bc;m so excited! The story goes like this:

I only have a dialup internet connection, so the website is only online when I am online. I&#x02bc;ve had to share with Aaron for the last three months (which is cool, because the phone bill gets split between us) so whenever I left the apartment, I went offline. Bummer for the site.

Well, yesterday Aaron got broadband installed, so he&#x02bc;s always online but never on the phone line. I&#x02bc;m not hooked into the &ldquo;swift river of information&rdquo; yet, but at least now I can leave my computer on the phone when I leave. It may only be a &ldquo;bubbling brook&rdquo; or &ldquo;dripping faucet&rdquo;, but it is so all the time!

Which allows me to bring to you (all two of you who read this) a real-time remote post. I&#x02bc;m not even at my computer right now. Imagine that.

I also got a webcam yesterday and have been showing it off to all my friends online. Some of my family that frequent the Internet haven&#x02bc;t seen it yet, and I can&#x02bc;t wait to show them. Technology rocks!

If there are more than two of you, post a comment and introduce yourself.
