Right back atcha, [Lyndsay](http://lyndsayctr.blogspot.com/). Mormon blogs are the coolest, and to find that there&#x02bc;s already a huge community of them is great. But then again, that&#x02bc;s how the Internet works, isn&#x02bc;t it? Just when you thought you were starting a trend, around the corner comes the parade to join you.

I mean, for you to join. Happy blogging!
