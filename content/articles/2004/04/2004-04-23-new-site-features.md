I did some site updates this morning, the most interesting being a short __bio section__ about myself. I realized that the site was getting more hits recently, and some of my friends are checking it out for the first time, so I thought it appropriate that I should at least identify myself a bit better. To get to the &ldquo;About William&rdquo; section, there&#x02bc;s a link above in this entry, or you can click on the author name of any entry that I&#x02bc;ve posted.

May your bandwidth rise and your ping time be minimal.

\[Update 2004-06-04 xx:xx\] The &ldquo;About William&rdquo; page is gone for now.
