I&#x02bc;m not really a talker. I never have been. &ldquo;I keeps myself to myself,&rdquo; as the English would say. Yet once every _\_insert large length of time here\__, I meet someone with whom I can talk and talk and talk like I have known them for a long time.

I have found such a person. It makes me happy.
