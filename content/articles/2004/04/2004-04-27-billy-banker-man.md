>  
> Billy the Banker bought his gun  
> (While under the influence of the broiling sun)  
> To get back at that Cheater-man  
> Known only affectionately as &ldquo;Dan&rdquo;.
> 
> &#x02bc;Twas a Colt, and a mighty fine pistol, friend,That Billy chose; Dan&#x02bc;s life would end  
> Before sunset in two days&#x02bc; time.(It&#x02bc;s your job to complete this rhyme.)
> 
> So the sun came up, and the sun went down,  
> And the stars shined bright, and the moon went &#x02bc;round.When the evening came on the second day  
> Bill called to Dan to come out and play.
> 
> Billy faced east and Dan faced west  
> And prepared for a classic quick-draw contest.  
> The sheriff was there to referee  
> (his money on Dan, I gaurantee).
> 
> A drummer-boy standing in a shady place  
> Began to beat as they took each pace.  
> One, and they took one step apart.  
> Two clearly heard a beating heart.
> 
> Three women turned, trying not to faint.  
> Four children stared without complaint.  
> Five birds sat silent in the trees.  
> Six feathers rustled in the evening breeze.
> 
> Seven crickets chirped unknowingly.  
> Eight leaves fell from the old shade tree.  
> Nine men felt time had slowed to a crawl.  
> Ten, this would end once and for all.
> 
> Dan spun &#x02bc;round and Billy did, too,And then came the part everyone thought they knew:  
> But Billy was blinded by the setting sun,  
> And Dan by the glare off of Billy&#x02bc;s gun.
> 
> No shots were fired, but both men fell.  
> Down went the sun and up came a yell.  
> Billy and Dan were helped to their feet.  
> They dusted themselves and walked off the street.
> 
> So ends the Ballad of the Banker-man  
> And his new business partner, Cheater-Dan.  
> Billy and Dan are now good friends,  
> And this is how the story ends.
