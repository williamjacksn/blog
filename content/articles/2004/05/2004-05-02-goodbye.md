I&#x02bc;ve decided that I am way too occupied with the site and the blog, so I am going to take a break for a while. The site will be offline most of the time, so if you are reading this and you link here from your site (Lyndsay, you&#x02bc;re probably the only one) it&#x02bc;d probably be good to get rid of the link. We wouldn&#x02bc;t want any &ldquo;Unable to connect to server&rdquo; errors, now would we?
