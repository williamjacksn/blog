Okay, I&#x02bc;m going to try this again. I&#x02bc;ve been really good about the journal/blog thing for a while. There&#x02bc;s no reason to stop now. Besides, the summer is coming, and I won&#x02bc;t be in school, so I&#x02bc;ll have all the time in the world, right?

You know when you get all depressed, and someone tries to cheer you up or give you advice, and you don&#x02bc;t want it? You just want to wallow in your misery, because it&#x02bc;s comfortable down there. Real comfortable. Well, I&#x02bc;m like that sometimes, unfortunately.

Fortunately, I&#x02bc;m not _always_ like that. But that is the reason I always hesitate to give advice to others. What would I know about their situation? Do I look well travelled and knowledgable? Is my middle name Solomon? I don&#x02bc;t think so.

I just wanted to make sure none of you were waiting expectantly for my advice column to appear in your local paper. You&#x02bc;ll be waiting a long time.

&ldquo;Now that we&#x02bc;re friends, I&#x02bc;ve decided to make you my new project!&rdquo;
