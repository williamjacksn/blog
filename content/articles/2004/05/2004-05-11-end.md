Imagine the most horrible ending. Maybe death. Or hell, if you&#x02bc;re Christian or something. Or maybe living forever with someone you really don&#x02bc;t like. Or living forever with someone you don&#x02bc;t know and don&#x02bc;t want to get to know. Sitting on a stool in a white-walled room staring at this person who won&#x02bc;t answer your questions. Eternally. That&#x02bc;s frustrating. But I digress.

So now that you have this horrible terrible end in mind, the trick is this: convince yourself that you will meet such an end if you don&#x02bc;t get at least a B on your exam this week. Really convince yourself. Sweat a bit, because that&#x02bc;s what will happen. 79.4 is your score? Sit on the stool. In fact, to make this more frustrating we&#x02bc;re going to make the guy on the other stool have no face. A Faceless Man dressed completely in white, sitting so still you can barely distinguish him from the wall twenty-something feet away. No shadows. You can squint, and yell maybe, and try to get him to move, but you&#x02bc;re not allowed to take your eyes off of him. This is the ultimate time-out we&#x02bc;re talking about.

Yet for some reason you don&#x02bc;t _want_ to take your eyes off of him. Because you just know that the moment you look away, he&#x02bc;ll move or sneeze or blink &mdash; he has no eyes, but you swear he&#x02bc;ll blink if you look away.

So go study and get a B or you&#x02bc;ll end like this.
