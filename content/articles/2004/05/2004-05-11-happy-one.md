A normal person, when in bliss, dreams of flowers and rabbits and baby chickens. I would like to know why. Another normal person, when in bliss, imagines chocolate. Now that&#x02bc;s personality. In fact, I now declare that to be that personaliable, you have to wear glasses, preferably the thick-rimmed kind. Because glasses are a sure sign of personality. Or bad natural eyesight. Which I have. I would say I have both (bad eyesight and personality) but one cannot declare oneself to have &ldquo;personality&rdquo;. And for good reason. It engenders humility, another trait which is good for anyone to have. Yes, if we all just humbly wore thick-rimmed glasses this world would be so much better.

Now I&#x02bc;m not saying the world is terrible at the moment. I would never say that. Much the opposite, actually. We have flowers, and rabbits and baby chickens, and most of all chocolate. Isn&#x02bc;t the world a great place?

Now I&#x02bc;ll go lay in a grassy field of clover and pretend the clouds look like circus animals. Send in the clowns.
