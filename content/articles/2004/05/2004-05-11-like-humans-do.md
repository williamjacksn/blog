I stayed up until 12:45 last night/this morning watching [_The Two Towers_][a]. That&#x02bc;s a great movie. But
it&#x02bc;s long. To quote myself, it was &ldquo;as long as my arm times two,&rdquo; and that&#x02bc;s long. I have long
arms. That&#x02bc;s why it&#x02bc;s long.

But anyway, I was thinking, why would anyone want to sit for such a long time watching a movie like that? I&#x02bc;ve
noticed that most movies that have been released recently are longer than movies released five years ago. I think we as
a human family have a pulsating attention span. We all have attention deficit disorder one decade, and patience like
nobody&#x02bc;s business the next. Why can&#x02bc;t we settle down? Perhaps it&#x02bc;s the tides.

Or El Niño. That would do it. I read [a great paper about El Niño][b] today, that explained the very reason we have such
a problem with it (El Niño): we as a society refuse to satiate Peruvian gods.

I knew it all along.
