I have been a stone all day. A big fat rock. Sitting and doing nothing. My trusty alarm clock/mobile phone ripped me from sleep at 6:30 as usual. I turned it off and laid back on my bed for a few minutes. Well, I thought it was a few minutes. I got up to look at the clock and was presented with a cheerful &ldquo;7:31&rdquo;. Most displeasing. I had 29 minutes to shower, dress, skip breakfast and bike frantically to the Undergraduate Library to be at work on time.

After the shortest shower of my life, I felt so rushed that I put on a t-shirt. A t-shirt! I never feel like myself in a t-shirt. However, if I was forced to wear a t-shirt, the one I&#x02bc;m wearing today is the one I would wear. It proudly proclaims &ldquo;My GPA Sucks&rdquo; in large block collegiate letters on solid blue.

The last time I wore this shirt, some random guy I passed on campus asked me what my GPA was. I was totally not expecting that, and he probably could tell, because when I&#x02bc;m walking toward a fixed destination I&#x02bc;m spaced out and concentrating fully on what I&#x02bc;m doing. I was probably looking at the ground to make sure I didn&#x02bc;t trip on a dog or someone&#x02bc;s shoe, and his question snapped me back into the real world, and I took about three seconds to think and respond. By this time I&#x02bc;m sure the guy was thinking, &ldquo;You don&#x02bc;t have to answer, man, I can tell already.&rdquo;

Yeah. So I told him what my GPA was, and he said, &ldquo;That doesn&#x02bc;t suck,&rdquo; or something to that effect &mdash; the details are vague &mdash; and I think I said something like, &ldquo;I know, but I can do better,&rdquo; and he was gone. What a conversation. Welcome to college life, where your clothing defines your individuality.

I made it to work on time, wheezing and hungry, and sat at a computer for three hours, and went home again. Then I borrowed my friend&#x02bc;s car and went to H-E-B to pick up a few items and keep the economy running smoothly. I had a list, like I was sent there by my mother, but I didn&#x02bc;t confine myself to the list. For instance, &ldquo;5 lb bag of frozen cut brocolli&rdquo; wasn&#x02bc;t on the list, but it&#x02bc;s in my freezer now. I&#x02bc;m flexible like that. Now you ladies can tick that box off on the list of things you look for in a guy. Tick off the &ldquo;prideful&rdquo; box, too, while you&#x02bc;ve got the list out.

Allow me to continue as if you are fascinated with my day to this point. I got home and put the groceries away, and started making lunch, and about this time Aaron left for studying or exams or whatever, and I had nothing to do. So I examined Aaron&#x02bc;s DVD collection &mdash; didn&#x02bc;t take long, there are only six DVDs to choose from &mdash; and selected &ldquo;Kids from Shaolin&rdquo;. It has a different name in China, something like 曼码勃ㄅ弊.

If you can picture it, I was sitting on the floor with a big bowl of rice, eating it with chopsticks, watching a chinese movie that required me to read subtitles. It was _A Chinese Experience_.

The rice was great and the movie was long, and before I knew it I couldn&#x02bc;t keep my eyes open, so I did the responsible thing by turning off the movie and trying to take a nap. Only the moment I laid down on my bed, I wasn&#x02bc;t sleepy anymore. That always happens.
