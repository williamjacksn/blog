Okay, I just got off the phone. I just had the most surreally random conversation this year. It went:

__Me:__ Hello?  
__Some Guy:__ Hello, may I speak to William please? _(I didn&#x02bc;t recognize the voice.)___Me:__ This is he.  
__Some Guy:__ Hello, William. This is Josh, from _\_I forgot the company name he said\__. I understand you&#x02bc;re interested in computers.__Me:__ Yes. _(At this point I&#x02bc;m thinking, &ldquo;He&#x02bc;s going to offer me a job for the summer. My prayers have been answered!&rdquo;)___Josh:__ Would you be interested in a Pentium III processor for 400 dollars?  
__Me:__ No I wouldn&#x02bc;t. _(I was really disappointed about not getting the job, so I decided to disappoint him.)___Josh:__ You wouldn&#x02bc;t? Do you know anyone who would?__Me:__ _(Impatient yet polite)_ No, I&#x02bc;m afraid I don&#x02bc;t.__Josh:__ _(Disappointed)_ You don&#x02bc;t.__Me:__ Nope. But thanks for the offer.  
__Josh:__ Okay, goodbye.

This just happened to me. This is not a joke. I still think it&#x02bc;s unbelievable.
