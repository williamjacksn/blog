> If you haven&#x02bc;t found something strange during the day, it hasn&#x02bc;t been much of a day. (John A Wheeler)

It&#x02bc;s only morning, so I don&#x02bc;t think I&#x02bc;ve found something strange _yet_. I can, however, understand the validity of Mr. Wheeler&#x02bc;s statement. In the past I would often write in my journal, &ldquo;It was a normal day. Nothing exciting or new happened.&rdquo; How uncool is that? I wasn&#x02bc;t looking hard enough. I wasn&#x02bc;t examining the details of life, or appreciating the things that matter.

A friend of mine recently inspired me to think on the small things that I am thankful for when I pray. One example she gave of a &ldquo;small thing&rdquo; was the scent of my mother. I have never thought to be thankful for such an integral yet somewhat subconcious part of my life. How many times have I hugged and kissed my mother, and felt comfort, security and love in her arms? The total is countless, no doubt, and she always had the same motherly scent about her. I am not familiar with biological processes, or sensory perception theories, but I know somehow that my perception of my mother would be drastically different if that scent were taken away right now.

Hence, I am thankful for the scent of my mother.
