Refering to yesterday&#x02bc;s Quote of the Day, I did actually end up finding something strange yesterday. My Computer Science professor gave a true/false final exam that I finished in 45 minutes. It&#x02bc;s the strangest thing I have ever seen or experienced in all my days as a university student.
