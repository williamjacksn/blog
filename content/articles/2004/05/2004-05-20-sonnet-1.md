>  
> The library is quiet in the morn,  
> As quiet as the death all men must take.  
> The lack of students makes me feel forlorn,  
> Resembling silent field and frozen lake.
> 
>  
> Before too long the noisy door swings wide:  
> With chilling draft a student passes through.  
> A pause; another student comes inside,  
> Then finally, a third steps into view.
> 
>  
> All hustle-bustle has this floor become!  
> These students do not speak with lowered voice!  
> They act as if they call this place their home,  
> And loudly claim they have no other choice.
> 
>  
> Oh, give me back my silent library!  
> I loved her, boring as she seemed to be.
