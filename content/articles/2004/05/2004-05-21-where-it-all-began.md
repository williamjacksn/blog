    Probably two or three years old. I&#x02bc;m not sure.
5.   Tell a funny story about your first year in school.  
    I tell this at my own peril!!! I was taught to raise my hand and wait for the teacher to call on me if I needed to say something. One day in kindergarten, I needed to say something, so I raised my hand and waited and waited and waited for the teacher to allow me to speak. When she finally did ask what I wanted to say, I told her, &ldquo;I wanted to say that I needed to go to the bathroom, but now it&#x02bc;s too late.&rdquo;
