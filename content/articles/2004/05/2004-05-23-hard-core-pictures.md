I learned something new today. Apparently, I am a &ldquo;hard core Mormon boy&rdquo;. Hard core, eh? Well, I suppose
that phrase _could_ apply. It wasn&#x02bc;t really at the top of my list of ways to define myself, though. Perhaps it
should be.

Hard core. I do __wear khakis__ all the time (and I mean _all the time_). That&#x02bc;s pretty hard core. Oh, and I
__part my hair in the middle__. Watch out, I&#x02bc;m on the edge! My bicycle is a __Liahona__. That tag in the top left
corner says &ldquo;Property of California Sacramento Mission&rdquo; (it belonged to my brother).

Need I say more? But I will &hellip; I own about __two dozen ties__. I could wear a different tie every day for almost a
month and never repeat. This was a blessing when I __served a mission__, because I _did_ wear a tie every day.

I have __ten siblings__, and they are all my best friends.

The voting appears to have been unanimous. Yes, I am a &ldquo;hard core Mormon boy&rdquo;, and have been so for a long
time now. And I like it.
