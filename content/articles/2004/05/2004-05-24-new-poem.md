I added a poem to the weblog today, but it was something I found buried in my email archives. I wrote it in 2000, so I
tweaked the authored-on date for the post, and it doesn&#x02bc;t appear here because I made Movable Type think I posted
it in October 2000.

The poem is called &ldquo;[Mix-it-up][a]&rdquo;.
