1.  What is your favorite childhood memory?  
    The only thing I can remember from my childhood is my brother, and our good friendship.
2.  If you could be reincarnated as anything besides human, who would you want to be?  
    I always wanted to fly, so some kind of bird is an obvious choice. I also thought that a turtle reflected my
    personality the best. He&#x02bc;s deliberate and thoughtful and patient. I&#x02bc;d like to be more like him.
3.  If you had to start your life all over, what are three things you would change?  
    This is a tough question, and I might have to cop out and say that I would never change anything. But in the
    interest of The Friday Five, the three changes I would make are:

    1.  I would spend more time practicing the piano while I was young. I wish now more than anything that I had taken
        the time when I had it!
    2.  I would say, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; to my parents and siblings more often.
    3.  I would listen more.
4.  If you had to forget everything in your life, except one thing, what would it be?  
    I would never forget that God lives!
5.  Do you have a lucky charm?  
    As people have flown into and out of my life, I have had many different &ldquo;lucky charms&rdquo;. They are usually
    connected with people. A dollar coin from my grandparents, a bracelet from a good friend, and even a ballpoint pen
    from a British bank have been &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; to me.
