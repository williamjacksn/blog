I was feeling artsy with nothing to do, and I&#x02bc;ve seen this done elsewhere, and I liked the look of it, so I attempted my own little collage. This is what I came up with. Sure, there are only nine pictures, but I have a feeling this is only the beginning.

I have also unknowingly supplied you with an optical illusion. Look carefully at the intersection of the white lines on the collage. Are there fuzzy grey dots there? How cool is that?

News: I just got a kitchen table!

(Note: one day I will learn how to focus my camera.) I bought it from Magdalena for the low low price of cheap. She got married recently, so she was moving and didn&#x02bc;t need it anymore. What a blessing!

Therefore, there is much to be happy about. Therefore, I am happy. Therefore, I am smiling. I would also like to take this moment to say, &ldquo;Quite frankly, I have the coolest friends in the world.&rdquo;
