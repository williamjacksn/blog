1.   If the world were to suddenly end right now, what do you wish you would have done?  
    I wish I would have seen it coming.
2.   How many times do you hit the snooze button before getting out of bed?  
    Goose egg. Why waste life?
3.   What cartoon do you enjoy watching from the present (or the past)?  
    The only cartoons I see anymore are _The Simpsons_ and _King of the Hill_.
4.   If you could go to any time and/or place in history, where/when would it be?  
    Oh, I get it. I would go back to meet the man who invented essay questions and shoot him. Seriously, though, I would go to Fayette, New York, 6 April 1830, to witness the organization of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://www.mormon.org/). As far as _living_ goes, I just couldn&#x02bc;t do without a computer. And the Internet. And lights. So anywhere/when with those items, and I&#x02bc;m good. I would also have to take all my friends along with me.
5.   If your life were a movie, what would it be rated and why?  
    My life would be rated PG most of the time, and PG-13 occasionally. The rating would be different if you included the shower scenes.
