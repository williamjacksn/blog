Fine art is hard to come by these days. There seems to have been a shortage ever since Leonardo went into retirement.
That&#x02bc;s [da Vinci][b], by the way, not [da katana][c]. The leader of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will _never_
go into retirement.

For this reason (the art shortage, remember?) I am thrilled to find [an acceptable offering to the art world][d]. All
these exhibits are reasonably priced ($1,000 &ndash; $25,000). From the looks of it, a few of them could beat up
Leonardo, too. That&#x02bc;s da katana, by the way, not da Vinci. _Nobody_ can beat up da Vinci.

It&#x02bc;s exhibits like this (I&#x02bc;m talking about art, remember?) that make me appreciate the vast creativity of
the global population. I fear, however, that 90 percent of the world&#x02bc;s creativity is found in 10 percent of its
people. Take, for instance, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird (with whom I am sure you are all familiar). I will recount
their story.

One day Mr. Eastman was having lunch over at Mr. Laird&#x02bc;s, and Mr. Laird was showing Mr. Eastman his underground
&ldquo;Laird Lair&rdquo;, as he liked to call it, to pass the time. On one table, Mr. Laird had several tubs of
certified lard and half a dozen box turtles. He was conducting experiments for his thesis, &ldquo;Increasing the Average
and Maximum Velocity of Turtles through Lubrication&rdquo;, and wanted to demonstrate some of his findings to his
friend.

Mr. Eastman tripped over a power cord that was very unsafely strewn across the walkway, and accidentally spilled his
bowl of green Jell-O® over the turtles. The spoon flew across the room and into a corner where stood Mr. Laird&#x02bc;s
favorite display-piece: the full battle dress of an ancient Samurai warrior. That, too, fell to the floor, and after the
dust settled there was silence for an extended period of time.

Mr. Laird, jaw open, looked upon the scene. Two years&#x02bc; worth of scientific study had been ruined, a priceless
artifact had been severely damaged, and Mr. Eastman stood sheepishly with Jell-O® down the front of his shirt. Mr. Laird
looked from the turtles, to the costume, to Mr. Eastman, back to the costume, and back to the turtles, then a smile
crept onto his face.

&ldquo;I need a pencil!&rdquo; he yelled as he ran up the basement steps. When Mr. Eastman found him in his study, he
was feverishly scribbling on the inside front cover of the D encyclopedia. Mr. Laird paused, then looked up at his
friend and said, &ldquo;I need names.&rdquo;

Then he noticed the room for what felt to him like the first time. On the far wall, above Mr. Eastman&#x02bc;s head, was
a framed print of [_Mona Lisa_][e] side by side with a print of [_Madonna and Child_][f]. In the corner was a statue of
[_David_][g]. The ceiling was patterned after the [_Sistine Chapel_][h].

On that fateful day last week, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created.

But I&#x02bc;m talking about art, remember?
