I had some chicken noodle soup today. The taste reminded me of the last time I was ill. I loved missing school because of a fever. One time, I couldn&#x02bc;t go to school for a whole week because my temperature was over 100Â°F. I didn&#x02bc;t feel sick, I never vomitted, and I had no headache or stomach pain, put my fever would not go away so I wasn&#x02bc;t allowed to go to school. It was wonderful.

P.S. I made some weblog upgrades, and now you can reply to _comments_!
