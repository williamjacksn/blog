You&#x02bc;re starring in a movie! Which celebrity will play &hellip;

1.   you?  
    Someone told me once that I look just like [Lee Ryan from the band Blue](http://www.officialblue.com/profile_lee.html), but I&#x02bc;m not so sure about that. A movie about me would be a musical, though, so there would of course be some singing and dancing going on. I don&#x02bc;t think it would be too hard to act like me, so I&#x02bc;m looking for someone who looks somewhat like me. If that didn&#x02bc;t matter, I would want Tom Hanks to play me, because he can play anything.
2.   your love interest?  
    Meg Ryan. In fact, just call the movie _You&#x02bc;ve Got Mail_. What a great movie. If Meg isn&#x02bc;t available, call Helen Hunt. Then call the movie _Castaway_. And add some songs.
3.   your best friend?  
    Tobey Maguire. He seems a down-to-earth guy, especially when he plays Peter Parker. He&#x02bc;s both cool and not-so-cool (I mean that in a good way!), and very real.
4.   your enemy?  
    I don&#x02bc;t have an enemy. What a boring movie!
5.   any family member?  
    Michael Richards would play my brother. He&#x02bc;s spontaneous like that.

On second thought, scratch all that and animate the thing.
