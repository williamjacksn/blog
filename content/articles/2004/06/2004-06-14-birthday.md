Everybody gather &#x02bc;round, it&#x02bc;s story time.

Let me tell you about Chloë. Chloë is cool. I know the word &ldquo;cool&rdquo; sounds a bit cliché, but you must understand this: Chloë invented cool. Back in &#x02bc;84, when she was born, no one knew how to describe her. Therefore, a new word was created. Thanks to Chloë, we can use the word &ldquo;cool&rdquo;.

This, however, is not the story of the word &ldquo;cool&rdquo;. This is the story of Chloë&#x02bc;s twentieth birthday.

About a week before her birthday, Chloë&#x02bc;s roommate Katie got together with some other friends and hatched a plot to throw a surprise party. Secrecy was of the utmost importance. As plans were finalized and a sufficient cover story was developed, Chloë had no clue what was in store for her.

The day came, and preparations were made including red velvet cake (Chloë&#x02bc;s favorite) and key lime pie ice cream from Baskin Robbins (Chloë&#x02bc;s favorite). Friends arrived and waited anxiously for her entrance.

Enter she did, and surprised she was, and happy. Fun was had by all.

The moral of this story is: don&#x02bc;t be intimidated by the girl who invented cool. She&#x02bc;s humble about it. That&#x02bc;s what makes her so cool.

But the moral of this story could also be: know your friends&#x02bc; favorite flavors of ice cream.
