I didn&#x02bc;t have to be at work until noon today, so I took the liberty of staying out a bit late last night. I do that often. Ask my friends. Anyway, I woke up to my alarm at 10:30 AM and bumbled around my apartment half-awake for a few minutes before stepping into the bathroom, fully prepared to be fully awakened by a fully delicious shower.

This is how I start the shower: Hot water knob one full turn to the right (because it&#x02bc;s backwards), then turn the &ldquo;transfer water from faucet to showerhead&rdquo; knob as far as it will go, then turn the cold water knob one-eighth turn to the left (because it&#x02bc;s not backwards). Then I give the temperature a minute to stabilize, then I get in.

I really wish that was how it happened this morning. Instead, it was hot water knob one full turn to the right &hellip; nothing. No water, not even a drip. I was half asleep and I had work to go to and I felt nasty and dirty and stinky and _there&#x02bc;s no water_.

So I bumble out of the bathroom and into the kitchen to try my luck with the kitchen sink. I&#x02bc;m still asleep, because an awake person would know that if the water didn&#x02bc;t work in the bathroom it won&#x02bc;t work in the kitchen. Well, it didn&#x02bc;t work in the kitchen. I even tried the hot _and_ the cold water just in case. No dice.

I tell my roommate, but I don&#x02bc;t know how long he has been awake, and he&#x02bc;s already showered and dressed and all that, so I get shafted because I slept in.

Fortunately, the water was back on at 10:55. I&#x02bc;m so lucky.
