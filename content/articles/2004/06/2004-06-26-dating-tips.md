Once again, a college newspaper has astounded me. Keep in mind this was on the opinion page, and it was, as noted, a
letter to the editor. Maybe the editor wanted to make fun of this guy. A lot of his &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; are
ridiculously disgusting. A few are good, like 16 and 26. Most of them I just don&#x02bc;t want to comment on.
