This weblog has been brought to you by Non-Ultra Dawn. _It&#x02bc;s not as strong as Ultra Dawn._ When you just don&#x02bc;t want your dishes to be their cleanest, there aren&#x02bc;t many products you can turn to. For the corner-cutter in all of us, there is Non-Ultra Dawn. This soap has been specially formulated to leave trace amounts of just about everything on just about anything. It can also be used as a shower gel for that just-woke-up-and-didn&#x02bc;t-take-a-shower feeling.
