If you live anywhere near the Austin area, you absolutely must go see _The Secret Garden_ at the Zilker Park outdoor theatre. It plays every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night from now until 7 August. It is free, and it is amazing. The acting and singing are of an unbelievable quality. The show stars two children, and another actor graduated from high school this past spring. These are a talented bunch.
