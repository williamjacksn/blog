&ldquo;Personal appearance&rdquo; is the only thread I can see that runs through each random thought my mind is about to vomit onto the keyboard. Each thought triggers another, in true stream of consciousness style.

While I was shaving my face this morning &mdash; technically it was this afternoon, but that&#x02bc;s another story completely &mdash; I seriously considered leaving the goatee on again. It has been described as &ldquo;artsy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wesly-ish&rdquo;, &ldquo;chubes&rdquo;, and &ldquo;red&rdquo;. I have never maintained facial hair before; either it&#x02bc;s not there, or it&#x02bc;s not maintained Why should I start now?

I was fixing my hair this morning &mdash; technically it was this afternoon, but that&#x02bc;s the same other story completely &mdash; when I decided to give up. My hair is not parted today. I thought through a few options, but all I had available to put in it at the time was wax, my hands, and Non-Ultra Dawn. I used none. That&#x02bc;s when I got the bright idea to wear a hat. I own several. There is one I especially like, a flat cap from England in a very drab brown color. It was perfect. Then my mind wandered to yesterday &hellip;

Yesterday I went up to the Arboretum (in an adventuresome way) to see ChloÃ« in action at her work. She was wearing the cutest hat. I don&#x02bc;t know what the name of the style is, but it was definitely tartan. And cute. So now I am disappointed that I am not allowed to wear a hat when I work at the lab.

But I did wear my flat cap on the bike ride _to_ the lab, and I will wear it on the bike ride _from_ the lab, and more and more until it has become an essential part of my identity.
