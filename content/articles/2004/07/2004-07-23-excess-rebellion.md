&ldquo;Excess ain&#x02bc;t rebellion,&rdquo; she wrote.

I took great pains to analyze a particular subject yesterday, and the results of said analyzation can be read in the previous post. &ldquo;And now, &hellip; I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay;&rdquo; For all of my analyzation, I didn&#x02bc;t learn a thing. This morning, because I didn&#x02bc;t have to be at work, I didn&#x02bc;t get out of bed at my regular time. I even set my alarm later than usual. I loafed. From when I got into my bed to when I got out, twelve hours elapsed. Twelve hours!

Excess of sleep _is_ rebellion, and it feels so good.
