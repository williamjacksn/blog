I had the opportunity to drive a BMW Z3. Unfortunately, it was a stick. This wouldn&#x02bc;t have been a problem for me normally, but it was a _touchy_ stick. The car stalled without a sound. _There was no sound_! There wasn&#x02bc;t even any movement. I put it in gear, let up on the clutch the tiniest bit, blinked, and the engine wasn&#x02bc;t running. I stalled it three times without pulling away. I couldn&#x02bc;t drive it.
