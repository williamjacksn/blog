![Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany in Universal Pictures&#x02bc; Wimbledon][a]

I was recently told that I look <del>strikingly similar to</del> like [Paul Bettany][b]. I have never seen one of his
films, but I vaguely see a resemblance, and I play along with the idea for the following reasons:

1.  I am English.
2.  I can finally truthfully say I am six feet and three inches tall.
3.  I am acting opposite [Kirsten Dunst][c] in a film about Wimbledon.

I have previously made it known to many that I prefer Kirsten Dunst with red hair &mdash; perhaps it&#x02bc;s just Mary
Jane Watson I prefer &mdash; but this morning I realized just how shallow that is. Therefore, I have decided that I no
longer have a Kirsten Dunst hair color preference.

My, she&#x02bc;s cute; and she has her hand on my face.
