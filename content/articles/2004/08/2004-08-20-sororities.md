The computer lab was reserved today, by the Pan-Hellenistic Council. Do you knowwhat that is? Sororities, that&#x02bc;s what that is. The sororities of the Universityof Texas at Austin reserved the entire Student Microcomputer Facility forSorority Registration.

This entails several hundred incoming freshmen ladies, mostly of upper-classupbringing, selecting the sorority they would like to join.
