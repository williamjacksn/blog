Operation Neverending Story production update! Day 114: Things are comeing alongright on schedule. So far, we seem to have only hit one major snag. Um, and thatis, I spent an hour this morning slowly googling towards an ever-increasinglyapparent realization that, to achieve the simple functionality I desired on mywebsite, I needed to burn every bridge between subtlecoolness.dyndns.org and therest of the Internet.

I then spent ten minutes carefully and methodically burning the aforementionedbridges.

I would explain, but I&#x02bc;ll spare you, reader. I will merely suggest _thinking_before making rash decisions. Learn from my mistakes.

And guys, dilate your eyes. I understand it&#x02bc;s a hit with the ladies.
