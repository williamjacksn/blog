What do you get when you mix together a cheap webcam, a Rubik&#x02bc;s CubeÂ®, some cheesy remixed Mario music, Windows
Movie Maker, and nothing to do on a Monday afternoon?

Ladies and gentlepersons, it is with great pleasure that I announce to you my debut work, entitled _Cube_. <del>My only
regret is that it is in Windows Media Video format.</del>

Enjoy!
