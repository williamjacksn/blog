How a holiday such as today is properly spent has long been the subject  
of prolonged argument and friendly dinner conversation. I have my  
opinions, and doubtless you have yours. Should I choose to sleep in or  
to arise early? That is the question I should ask of myself.  
  
It was really easy to answer that one. I woke up at 7:00 AM. I was  
invited to play soccer down at Zilker Park with some of my friends. I  
was kindly picked up at 8:30 and arrived at the park at 9:00. The play  
was great, and the sun was shining brightly. I got exhausted rather  
quickly; I haven&#x02bc;t played soccer or engaged in any intense physical  
activity for quite some time now, and I was not used to it. My body was  
reminded how to sweat.  
  
I also squeezed in a few minutes of good tree-climbing time.  
  
As my friend drove me home at 11:30, rain began to fall. Hard. The rain  
gave off that pleasant rain-smell that I love. The earth, the air, the  
sky and everything smells so fresh and clean when the rain comes.
