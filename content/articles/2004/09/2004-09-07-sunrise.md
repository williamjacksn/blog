Last night, right before I went to bed, I got a brilliant idea for something to write about this morning. I looked at my Buddy List and quickly calculated that 70% of the people who were online had an away message set. I thought to myself, &ldquo;I used to do that. Now I just shut the program off when I go somewhere, for example, to bed.&rdquo; So I shut the program off, logged off of my computer and went to bed.

In the final moments of awakedness I was already planning and proofing my paragraphs of social commentary and wit. I&#x02bc;m online, but you can&#x02bc;t talk to me. _\_insert something (preferrably witty) about the irony of away messages here\__

Fortunately, I didn&#x02bc;t. I was at the bus stop at 07:20 this morning, and I saw the sky. I saw the most beautiful sky, I knew that even if I had a camera worth a million billion dollars there was no way to capture the beauty, the energy, the color and the wonder of this morning&#x02bc;s sky. Life is so full of wonder, there is no time to waste on pointless social commentary.

If ever a man were to paint a uniquely stunning sunrise only once a month his entire adult life I would be impressed beyond measure.

If I were to find someone who could do it every morning of every day for all eternity, I would worship him.
