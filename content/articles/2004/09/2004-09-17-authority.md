I don&#x02bc;t particularly enjoy being frustrated with the police.

I was standing at the Baja Fresh corner (northwest), and I wanted to cross Guadalupe. I waited for my walking man to light up so I could be a good citizen and cross when it was my turn. Just as the Guadalupe traffic light was turning amber, this police cruiser pulled up, intending to make a left turn onto 21<sup>st</sup> Street. The light turned red, and the police car was sitting in the middle of _my_ crosswalk. Those officers looked oblivious, too.

I was so unhappy about having to walk around the car that I took a picture as soon as I got to the other side of the street.
