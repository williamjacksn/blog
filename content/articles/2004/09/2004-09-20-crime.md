I love my university.

Speaking of crime, &hellip;

1.   I suddenly got the urge to get my lip pierced, but I didn&#x02bc;t have the money to do it professionally, so I tried to go about it myself. I probably didn&#x02bc;t leave the ice on my lip long enough, because I sure felt something when I tried to push that bent fork prong through.
2.   I got in a fight and some dude sucker-punched me in the face, and my teeth almost went all the way through my lip. That was the only hit he got in, though. I snapped and plowed into the fool. You should have seen how I left him.
3.   The driver of a Mazda Miata wasn&#x02bc;t looking and turned from a side street into my lane right in front of me. I didn&#x02bc;t have time to stop, but just enough time to slow down so the airbag didn&#x02bc;t blow when I hit him. I wish it had, because my face hit my steering wheel. Is that my fault? From the look of all those dents, those little Miatas don&#x02bc;t like getting bumped around too much.
4.   I opened a cupboard door into my face and bled all over my bathroom sink.
5.   None of the above.
