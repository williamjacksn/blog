If you have read my poem _The Librarian_ you may think I hold librarians near and dear to my heart. Well, you&#x02bc;re right. There is a librarian out there that is very special to me, that is trying to raise money to replace some old worn-out furniture at her library. Help her out by reading [her big idea](http://ideashappen.msn.com/entries/default.aspx?id=7511), then clicking &ldquo;I&#x02bc;m feelin&#x02bc; it&rdquo;.
