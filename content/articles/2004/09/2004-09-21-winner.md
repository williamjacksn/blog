I woke up three days ago with the best idea for a flash cartoon: Awarding Nobelprizes in the style of the Academy Awards, or if you&#x02bc;re daring, the MTV MovieAwards.

Stephen Hawking would MC.

&ldquo;This year&#x02bc;s Nobel Prize in Chemistry goes to &hellip; Professor vonBruenhousen, for his work identifying inherent chemical differences betweenTexans and other Americans! That&#x02bc;s as awesome as those full-color illustrationsof light cones in my _Brief History of Time_!&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&#x02bc;d like to thank the University, and all the little people who volunteered formy tests. And the Texans, too.&rdquo;

Well, the idea seemed really funny when I woke up that morning.
