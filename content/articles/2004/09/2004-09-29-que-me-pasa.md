¡Ay! [Like all things Spanish, the Grim Reaper is dangerous.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xvxbld7eeceosjj/20040511-nino.pdf)

In high school I studied French, but most of my siblings learned Spanish. Trust them to do the practical thing. Anyway, because I lived in a household predominantly occupied by Spanish speakers, I couldn&#x02bc;t help but pick up a few phrases.

My favorite is, &ldquo;Tengo una familia grande y una casa muy pequeña.&rdquo; &#x02bc;Nuff said.
