I still love rain. This batch came out of nowhere and hit the city hard. Cars were sliding everywhere, even into other cars. I got wet; but I got to wear my cabby hat and my newly-dubbed &ldquo;shoplifting coat&rdquo;.

No, I do not shoplift, but I think I look cool in my coat. I do not think I look cool because I look like I might engage in illegal activities. I think I look cool because I think I look like [John Cusack](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000131/) as Lloyd Dobler in [_Say Anything_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0098258/). He is cool.

Happy birthday, Aaron!
