I am so mainstream that I went to take the [Which Subculture Are You Quiz](http://quizilla.com/users/arsenicsugar/quizzes/Which%20Subculture%20Are%20You%3F/), and none of the questions had answers that I could honestly choose. Six questions, seven answers apiece: forty-two radio buttons, and not a single one applied to me.

Okay, I may be exaggerating a bit; but Question One was, &ldquo;Some Bands That You Listen To Include:&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Postal Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;Death Cab for Cutie&rdquo; were listed in different choices. I was as confused as cheese on a peanut butter sandwich.

Question Three, &ldquo;Some Words To Describe You Are:&rdquo; could have been answered thusly: &ldquo;Quiet, Intelligent, &amp; Independent&rdquo;. However, I try not to refer to myself as intelligent although others have told me I am, and I don&#x02bc;t really think I&#x02bc;m all that independent either.

And I most certainly would never put a comma after the word &ldquo;Intelligent&rdquo; in that context.
