![Do not enter! Alarmed custodians!](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/wk94njhamivbie7/20041026-alarmed.jpg)

Is there really anything I could say that would make this sign any funnier? Here I am, walking down the hall in the [Engineering-Science Building](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/ens.html), when my consciousness gets slammed with this piece of paper taped to a closed door. Am I supposed to understand what this means?

I follow the sign&#x02bc;s advice and pass by the room without entering. Honestly, at this point in my life, the last thing I want to see is an alarmed custodian.
