I watched Napoleon Dynamite for the fourth time last night. Right on. My Monday night Family Home Evening group went to St. Edward&#x02bc;s University to see the free showing. On the way out, customarily, I began freestyle walking all over the place. I did a two-footed wall plant off of some building when one of the guys said, &ldquo;You need to go higher!&rdquo; He then proceeded to practically walk up the wall. It was amazing.

I took a closer look at the side of the building, and noticed the rocks or stones or bricks or whatever the builders used to build it were quite irregular, and I could probably just scale it. I started to try, but a young woman who was passing by politely and authoritatively suggested that I stop.

She was wearing a lanyard. You can&#x02bc;t argue with that.
