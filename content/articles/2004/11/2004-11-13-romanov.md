This is a quickie, so I don&#x02bc;t forget.

Chloë invited me to dinner with some of her friends. The temptation to take up residence at Northcastle is growing. All I need is a car. Christmas is around the corner! I&#x02bc;ll put &ldquo;car&rdquo; on my list.

The next time you eat strawberries, be certain you know whether or not they are covered in brandy. Beware the French (and the Russians).

I also was invited to go dancing with friends. Oh yeah. Salsa isn&#x02bc;t just hot and spicy, it&#x02bc;s hot and spicy _and_ got a good beat (and excellent for keeping the cold weather away). Then there was rolling down the big hill until we were sufficiently dizzy. At least I felt sober when I was driving.

I have got to get some stars in my bedroom.

> On Thursday night Chloë invited me to dinner with friends. We went to a cozy little French bistro-type place called La Madeleine. It was my first time, my La Madeleine de-virginization, and one of the servers offered me some Strawberries Romanov. I asked him what it was, and could have sworn he said it contained brandy. Naturally, upon learning this information, I declined.

I told her what my understanding of the dish was, and she (and Katie) said that couldn&#x02bc;t be true, because someone had brought such a dish to one of our church dinners one time.
