title: I Finally Got Comment Spammed
urlname: spammed

This morning when I woke up and started my daily Internet rounds, I noticed a bunch of strange comments on my weblog. Spam! Ever since I started this site, I have read in various forums and on other weblogs about people getting comment spammed, or getting a load of comments advertising drugs or Texas Hold &#x02bc;Em. I had never seen it before on my own site.

Until today! I deleted 18 comments this morning. It&#x02bc;s not much, really, considering I hadn&#x02bc;t implemented any anti-spam features here. I guess I&#x02bc;m lucky.

And in need of help for my Texas Hold &#x02bc;Em game.
