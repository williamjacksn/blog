Hi, my name is William and I&#x02bc;m employed. How lucky can one guy be?

Hi, my name is William and my bed is so comfortable (I&#x02bc;d let you give it a try, but I&#x02bc;m afraid I might get scabies). It&#x02bc;s soft and warm, and there&#x02bc;s even a Sesame Street blanket someone made for me when I was born.

Hi, my name is William and about four years ago I applied to study at a certain university. Said application was accepted. How many people in the world get that chance? Out of everyone in the world who applied to this university, I was one of the few accepted. Why did it work out that way?

Hi, my name is William and I was born with best friends. Five of them. Then five more came along later on. We&#x02bc;re still best friends. And here&#x02bc;s a shout-out to the siblings. Don&#x02bc;t forget the two most loving and best parents in the world, which belong to me, and numerous extended family members to whom I am not ashamed, but rather ecstatic to be related. Why did it work out that way?

Hi, my name is William and God loves me.
