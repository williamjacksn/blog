That&#x02bc;s right, impulse. And I&#x02bc;m not talking about subwarp speeds, Captain Picard.

Completely on impulse, I went to Waco for two days. I was helping my friend pack his things for the winter break, when I looked at my schedule &mdash; I&#x02bc;m never without my schedule, it helps prevent impulsiveness &mdash; and realized that I was doing nothing, _nothing_ for two days. So we stopped at my apartment and I packed up a bag quickly and we were on the road to Waco!

I&#x02bc;m starting to shop impulsively, too. Perhaps that&#x02bc;s just Christmas coming to get me, though. I have so many people that I want to get things for, especially because I have been forgetting birthdays left, right and center the entire year. And somehow, I have the funds. It must be a blessing.

So, &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo; to all. And don&#x02bc;t forget to impulsively wear clothing you haven&#x02bc;t worn since you were fourteen years old. Now, who&#x02bc;s up for a Pinewood Derby?
