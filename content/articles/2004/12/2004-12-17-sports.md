I went with some friends to see my very first live hockey game. There was a lotof yelling, and a few fights. Then the game started. I have to admit, theLubbock Cotton Kings seemed to handle the puck with more elegance and grace thanthe Austin Icebats. But as you know, elegance and grace ne&#x02bc;er won manlyhockey game.

The only time Lubbock scored was when two (2) of the Austin players were in thepenalty box. At the end of the game it was tied 2-2. Therefore, there was fiveminutes of sudden-death overtime. Let us all rejoice, for the Icebats scoredwith 55 seconds left and we didn&#x02bc;t have to wait for a shootout.

The best show the whole night was the people on the outside of the glass,banging on it whenever the opposing team skated by. Weird. Oh, and the Icebatmascot threw us a t-shirt. Super cool.
