On the Saturday evening of December 4 just past, I was at the LDSInstitute of Religion. That evening, many young people gathered to makegingerbread houses and watch a performance. The &ldquo;gingerbread&rdquo; was reallygraham crackers, but the performance was real. I was privileged to be apart of &ldquo;The Forgotten Carols&rdquo; by Michael McLean.

But I digress.

As I was observing the graham cracker house making, I ate somechocolate. This was not an abnormal practice of mine. In fact, it wasquite in the ordinary for me to ingest chocolate on occasion. Quite asmuch in the ordinary as the next man, naturally. The _real_ excitementcomes later.

The following Wednesday, being December 8, I was at work talking with Inbar.We have a tin of candy at work to which we can helpourselves at any time. I was in the act of helping myself to a[Reese&#x02bc;s® Peanut Butter Cup](http://www.reeses.com/products/pbcups.asp), when Inbarmentioned that she thought she was addicted to chocolate. After herexplanation, I was thoroughly convinced that she was indeed addicted tochocolate, and I suggested she stop eating it.

She certainly wouldn&#x02bc;t have any of that. I told her that I would stop,too. And I did. I replaced the Reese&#x02bc;s® Peanut Butter Cup withoutopening it. But she didn&#x02bc;t. Stop, that is. So now I&#x02bc;m not eatingchocolate for no reason whatsoever. And I&#x02bc;m actually enjoying it!However, the _real_ excitement comes later.

Yesterday, I found myself again at work, and I was on shift withInbar, when our supervisor walked over to our desk from heroffice with a large (that is to say, _large_) slice of cake. She offeredit to us, and I began to laugh. And Inbar began to laugh.Because the cake was _the most chocolatest chocolate cake with chocolatefrosting I have ever seen in my entire life_!

And yes, Inbar enjoyed it.
