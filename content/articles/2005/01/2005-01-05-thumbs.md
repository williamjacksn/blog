So basically, my coworker is the coolest. I come home to Austin from my vacation to discover that he has given me a
Christmas gift.

But it&#x02bc;s not just any Christmas gift. It&#x02bc;s [The Legend of Zelda][b], for the [Nintendo Entertainment
System][c]! The cartridge is gold and everything! Oh man, I&#x02bc;ve already started playing it. It&#x02bc;s so
awesome, I just can&#x02bc;t speak.

I&#x02bc;m really a cop-out when it comes to classic games, though. The first thing I did was go to [the online
walkthrough][d] for the game, so I wouldn&#x02bc;t miss anything. I found out that I am _terrible_ at any Nintendo game
that doesn&#x02bc;t have the words &ldquo;Mario 3&rdquo; in the title.

But I am still stoked beyond all comprehension. You should all come over to my place and play Nintendo games with me. My
next planned acquisition is [Metroid][e].
