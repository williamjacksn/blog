Actually, I&#x02bc;m sure a lot of people would be curious if I didn&#x02bc;t answer my phone for a while and
didn&#x02bc;t show up to Church on Sunday and missed work on Monday. I sure hope Aaron would assume something was wrong
if I didn&#x02bc;t come home without letting him know.

Okay, okay, okay, so there are some people that love me. I guess I&#x02bc;ll just have to accept that. But don&#x02bc;t
let&#x02bc;s look at the big picture for the moment, and let&#x02bc;s talk about how boring my afternoon has been.

On the other hand, don&#x02bc;t let&#x02bc;s talk about how boring my afternoon has been until we talk about how
exciting my morning was. It was sprinkling. Hurrah. I caught my bus, which I haven&#x02bc;t done all week because I
insist on reading the Internet for an hour before I even get in the shower. It&#x02bc;s a good thing I caught my bus,
too, because it was sprinkling, and a wet William, as one would assume, is not necessarily a pleasant William.

Continuing with the excitement, I mentored a new employee at the lab. He&#x02bc;s cool. Also, when I went to the _other_
lab to work at noon, I scanned some slides from 1983/4. I understand now why everyone thought my brother and I were
identical twins. I could hardly tell which one was me! This is not quite so evident in the supplied photograph. Trust
me.

At this point I have forgotten why I was so bored. All I know is that I was bored enough to stick my face in one of the
flatbed scanners. It really is gross. I&#x02bc;m not sure why it is red, but I think my nose looks like a strawberry.
And isn&#x02bc;t that lip-scar just awesome?

Mmmm, strawberries.
