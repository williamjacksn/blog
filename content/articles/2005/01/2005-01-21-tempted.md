I&#x02bc;m more tempting than homework. She said so.

This entry was too impulsive and too barren; I needed to write a poem.And here it is:

>  
> If I fail it&#x02bc;s all your fault,But I won&#x02bc;t give you the blame.I&#x02bc;d be passing all the sameHad you never talked to me.
> 
> You can&#x02bc;t help it; you&#x02bc;re too sweet,Conversations to refuse.  
> Newfound friendships to peruse  
> Become your bread and butter.
> 
> You&#x02bc;re more tempting than my books,And rightly so, you should be.  
> We are complementary,  
> and I&#x02bc;m not talking colors.
