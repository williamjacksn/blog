I&#x02bc;m so excited to see [_Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith_][c] that I am going to stay awake until it
hits theatres in May. I really should be in bed right now. I should be sleeping, because I have to beat work early in
the morning.

At first glance I would definitely think nothing exciting happened today. It rained all day. I love rain. I love Texas,
because it rains instead of snows in the winter. I went to class, and had the pleasure of running into friends along the
way. It makes me feel good when I can randomly cross paths with someone I know on a campus of almost 50,000 students.
Actually, I bumped (figuratively) into the same girl twice today.

I also went to work today, at which I brushed up on my knowledge of scanning and text recognition on the Macs; and my
Photoshop skills (displayed herein). Girls only want boyfriends with good skills, and I think my computer hacking skills
are coming along quite nicely.

Yesterday I burned a DVD for the very first time, ever. I took the production of &ldquo;The Forgotten Carols&rdquo; that
I played a small part in, exported it from VHS to a computer, then burned it onto one of these Digital Versatile Discs.
Everything appeared fine, but there are some parts on the DVD that are messed up [like Strong Sad on caffeine][d]. Looks
like I&#x02bc;ll have to do it all over again. The only catch is that it takes ninety minutes to get the movie from the
videotape onto the computer, because it has to play at normal speed. And it takes three hours to burn the movie onto a
DVD. The import process automatically cuts the video into segments of about ten minutes in length, so it takes thirty
minutes to an hour in between to set up the movie clips and get the DVD menus right. I&#x02bc;d have to be at the
computer lab all day!

It&#x02bc;s not like that has never happened.
