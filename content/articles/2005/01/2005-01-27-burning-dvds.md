I&#x02bc;m so excited to see [_Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/)that I am going to stay awake until it hits theatres in May. I reallyshould be in bed right now. I should be sleeping, because I have to beat work early in the morning.

At first glance I would definitely think nothing exciting happenedtoday. It rained all day. I love rain. I love Texas, because it rainsinstead of snows in the winter. I went to class, and had the pleasure ofrunning into friends along the way. It makes me feel good when I canrandomly cross paths with someone I know on a campus of almost 50,000students. Actually, I bumped (figuratively) into the same girl twicetoday.

I also went to work today, at which I brushed up on my knowledge ofscanning and text recognition on the Macs; and my Photoshop skills(displayed herein). Girls only want boyfriends with good skills, and Ithink my computer hacking skills are coming along quite nicely.

Yesterday I burned a DVD for the very first time, ever. I took theproduction of &ldquo;The Forgotten Carols&rdquo; that I played a small part in,exported it from VHS to a computer, then burned it onto one of theseDigital Versatile Discs. Everything appeared fine, but there are someparts on the DVD that are messed up [like Strong Sad on caffeine](http://homestarrunner.com/sbemail91.html).Looks like I&#x02bc;ll have to do it all over again. The only catch is that ittakes ninety minutes to get the movie from the video tape onto thecomputer, because it has to play at normal speed. And it takes threehours to burn the movie onto a DVD. The import process automaticallycuts the video into segments of about ten minutes in length, so it takesthirty minutes to an hour in between to set up the movie clips and getthe DVD menus right. I&#x02bc;d have to be at the computer lab all day!

It&#x02bc;s not like that has never happened.
