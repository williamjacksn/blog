8.8/10. I just rated my day. [My sisters&#x02bc; habits](http://www.xanga.com/mary_jay/195007212/item.html) are rubbingoff on me.

Of course, I completely understand how premature it is of me to rate theday before it is over. Any number of good and/or bad occurences couldchange this score before sundown. Or midnight, depending on yourreckoning. And the word on the street is I have some serious bad luckcoming, because yesterday I was walking around the [Flawn AcademicCenter](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/fac.html) with my umbrella wide open. Everyone knows it&#x02bc;s healthierfor an umbrella to dry wide open.

Why didn&#x02bc;t I give today a nice, round nine? Because I haven&#x02bc;t doneanything extremely interesting. I started work at 07:45 and have beenhere ever since. I ate [Taco Bell](http://www.tacobell.com/) for lunch. It isn&#x02bc;t raininganymore. Rain would definitely have pulled the score up at least a tenthof a point.

Well, why didn&#x02bc;t I give today a nice, round eight? Because today&#x02bc;s gotpotential. I am reburning the DVD of which I spoke previously, becausethere were some problems with it. I&#x02bc;m hoping everything will be betterthis time around. I&#x02bc;m definitely hopeful. Definitely.

\[Update 2005-01-28 16:00\] Success! I&#x02bc;m tempted to bump the score to 9.0,but let&#x02bc;s not be hasty.
