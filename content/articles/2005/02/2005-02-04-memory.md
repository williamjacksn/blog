I feel so bad! Yesterday I was meandering down the hallway in [Robert A.Welch Hall](http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/wel.html), when I heard someone say my name. I looked up andrecognized her face, but couldn&#x02bc;t remember from where. I decided to behonest and avoid beating around any nearby bushes, so I said,

&ldquo;I feel really bad. I know you, but I don&#x02bc;t remember your name.&rdquo;

She told me her name, and even then, I had to think for two secondsbefore I could place her. This was a girl I saw at most once a week forabout a month and a half. It had been at least three months since I hadseen her last.

This occurred early in the morning. She said, &ldquo;You probably didn&#x02bc;trecognize me because I&#x02bc;m wearing glasses and I look like crap.&rdquo;

I&#x02bc;ll buy the glasses comment, because they _did_ make her lookdifferent. But why do so many girls think that just because it&#x02bc;s before11 AM, they are wearing a University hoodie, and lack makeup, that they&ldquo;[look like crap](http://nts.umd.edu/~mark/bed_head.jpg)&rdquo;?

Every girl (and by &ldquo;every&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;_every_&rdquo;) that has ever told me thathas been dead wrong.
