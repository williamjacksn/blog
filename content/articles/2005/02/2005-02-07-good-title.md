Today I went to Family Home Evening at the stake center instead of myusual place. I always start with the end of the day, and skip thebeginning. Let me start over.

I worked for at least seven hours today. I was going to mentor four newemployees at the lab (four in one day&mdash;a new record!) but one had topostpone. Three new employees mentored in one day&mdash;a new record! Thismeant I did a lot of talking. I talked for at least four full hourscumulatively, and that was just at work. This meant I drank a lot ofwater. I think I drank too much water, because I began to feel sick.Ick.

After work I went to Institute class. I was really tired, and I fellasleep on my desk. This was another incident when I was sitting on thefront row. My instructor is kind enough to never mention it to me, butat least two (2) of the other students asked me if I got enough sleeplast night. Of course I didn&#x02bc;t. _Final Fantasy VII_ is robbing me of myslumber.

A particularly kind Hispanic woman offered me a ride home, which Iwhole-heartedly accepted because I hadn&#x02bc;t seen or spoken with theaforementioned Hispanic woman for over a month. [&ldquo;Hot time!&rdquo; saidWilliam.](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail123.html) Once home, I whipped up some of my famous homemade Ramennoodle soup. Mmmmm (sp?). My friend who was going to drive to FamilyHome Evening came ten minutes early, so she checked out all her emailswhile I finished up all my Ramens.

Then it was onward and upward to Family Home Evening, where the lessonwas effectively entitled, &ldquo;Prayer; How many bars do you have?&rdquo; Cleverand meaningful it was, yes, clever and meaningful. We attempted to playlife-sized foosball (keyword: attempted) then either finished the gameor gave up, depending on your perspective, and settled for somedelicious frozen custard. When everyone started leaving, an impromptubasketball game picked up amongst eight people; I was one of the eight.Surprise surprise. Impromptu basketball is not to be confused withimprovisational comedy, neither of which I am very good at.

So my foot got sore, and my shirt got ripped, and my breath got knocked,but I had a good time. For the most part it was girls v. boys. I was onthe girls&#x02bc; team.

On the ride home I found myself (a) pumping gas for my driver, (b)cleaning my driver&#x02bc;s windshield, and (c) explaining to my driver thedifference between deterministic and nondeterministic finite statemachines. If you ask me, vending machines are key.

Because you made it thus far, oh thou loyal reader, I shall now explainthe photograph. &#x02bc;Twas her birthday, and she is a dear friend, and that&#x02bc;show I show my love for dear friends on their birthdays. Even if itwasn&#x02bc;t her birthday, people who know HTML have a special bond.
