I went to Taco bell for lunch today, and I decided I wanted three softtacos and a medium drink. When it was my turn to place my order, I said,

&ldquo;I&#x02bc;ll have three soft tacos and a medium drink, please.&rdquo;

After some subsequent cash register button pressing, the man behind thecounter said, &ldquo;That will be $4.29. No, wait. I&#x02bc;m going to make thatthree soft tacos and a large drink, and that will be $3.99.&rdquo;

Who can argue with that? I love you, combo meals.

Boycott all you want. I&#x02bc;m going to continue to eat at Taco Bell. Goahead and create a facebook group in honor of The Guy at Wendys in theUnion. He never saved me thirty cents. As for me and my debit card, wewill serve the Taco Bell.

So I went down to the Union Underground and ate my tacos. 630 calorieslater, I am a happy man.
