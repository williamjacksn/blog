I really like the new proctors this semester. I have mentored them all,and worked several hours with most of them. I was looking forward tomany enjoyable hours proctoring the [SMF](http://www.utexas.edu/smf/) with all my new coworkers.This is why it pains me to know that one of them is being transferred tothe (villainous) [Communication Computer Center](http://www.utexas.edu/computer/labs/ccc/).

She didn&#x02bc;t think it was such a good idea, either.

I tried to cheer her up.

Most proctors would ratherwork there than here. Okay, every proctor I have ever met except mewould rather work there instead of here at the [SMF](http://www.utexas.edu/smf/). It&#x02bc;s morelaid-back, you get to study when it&#x02bc;s quiet, &hellip;

This is the risk you take when you enter this business. You could betransferred at a moment&#x02bc;s notice. It&#x02bc;s all part of the Proctorlifestyle.

My dear fellow proctor, I wish you all happiness and smiles as you bravethis new territory.
