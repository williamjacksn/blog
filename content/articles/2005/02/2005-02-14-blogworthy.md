I warn you, I&#x02bc;m talking about things that occur in restrooms (again).

I went to the men&#x02bc;s room on the second floor of the Flawn AcademicCenter, to do what people do in men&#x02bc;s rooms. When I exited my stall, Isaw a man walk away from one of the urinals with a book in his hand.

_He had a book in his hand!_

He walked straight to the door. That&#x02bc;s right, he forgot to sanitize. Istood there, utterly dumbfounded by the surrealism of what I had justwitnessed. I recognized him, too. He works here. I&#x02bc;m never shaking hishand. Ever.

In related news, I remember my friend mentioning to me how spacious thehandicap stalls are. &ldquo;They&#x02bc;re nice and roomy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I could set upshop in there.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Set up shop?&rdquo; I don&#x02bc;t even want to know what he meant by that.
