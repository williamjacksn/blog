Lisa suggested &mdash; no, _insisted_ &mdash; that I mention something that happenedSaturday night.

We had left the [Millennium Youth Entertainment Complex](http://myec.net/) and were insome residential neighborhood looking for a particular house, where wewould be watching a movie with friends. I noted the house numbers andinformed the driver that we were going in the wrong direction and neededto turn around. As she pulled into some random driveway, the headlightsof her car illuminated a young man standing with his face to the wall ofthe house there. He appeared to be urinating, but I can&#x02bc;t be certain.

I can, however, be certain of the uncontrollable laughter that escapedour lips.

I could take a moment to put myself in his shoes and try to understandhow he felt about this, but I won&#x02bc;t. I&#x02bc;d rather discuss what I was doingat the Millennium Youth Entertainment Complex Saturday night. I wasbowling.
