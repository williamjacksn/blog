A day late and a dollar short, I wanted to wait until my Valentine&#x02bc;s Daywas over before I commented on how much I loved it. At his very momentI&#x02bc;m rather overwhelmed at the happiness I seem to be displaying in thepicture. I didn&#x02bc;t realize at the time how content my smile made me look.It was a happy day, for some reason.

At the bottom of the picture a small red smudge is visible. That&#x02bc;ssweet&#x02bc;n&#x02bc;sour sauce from Hoa Hoa, the best Chinese restaurant in DobieMall, and the cheapest, and the only. I have a weekly lunch date there.The sweet&#x02bc;n&#x02bc;sour sauce is always good, but this time I decided to takesome with me, obviously. I also ate the obligatory fortune cookie, andone can faintly make out the fortune taped to my shirt just below thefading barcode. We&#x02bc;ll get to that in a minute.

To the right is a blue smiling heart. That was a gift from one of mycoworkers. Thank you!

Goodness, I have skinny arms. Anyway, on to the fortune:
