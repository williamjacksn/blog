Can anyone imagine the day I give up computers completely?

Or, more specifically, can anyone imagine that day being any day otherthan the day I die?

Yeah, me neither.

Several months ago, I was searching for some information to help me withmy site, when I came across [a website that helped me quite a bit](http://diveintomark.org/).The author of this site was an accomplished programmer, and I learned alot from him. He gave some cool tips that I implemented on my site, andin the process I learned more about the [software](http://httpd.apache.org/) [that](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/)[powers](http://www.mysql.com/) Subtle Coolness.

Then one day in October 2004, this author [simply wrote](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/10/18/exit),

His website hasn&#x02bc;t changed since. Could I ever do that? Those who knowme would probably say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;

[&ldquo;Heck no at all.&rdquo;](http://homestarrunner.com/sbemail123.html)

With that said, those who know me would probably confirm that I spendtoo much time at a computer. Considering I almost always have a computer_in my pocket_, I am inclined to agree.

This week I backed off. This week I _exercised_.

&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; you say. But yes, this week I exercised; and I exercised morethan once; and I enjoyed it. I have decided to swim every day the swimcenter is open (except Sunday, of course). Unfortunately, the swimcenter is closed today, so no swimming for me.

Swimming is awesome. You get a good workout, in your arms and your legs,and you get out of breath, and there is always someone there to save youif you pass out. As a bonus, you&#x02bc;re not sore the next day. All thatwater is doing wonders for my skin.

The whole locker room experience still scares me, though.
