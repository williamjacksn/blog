Subtle Coolness has recently taken a backseat to some other projects ofmine. Most notably, I just started a website for my family to keep intouch more easily, and it&#x02bc;s been a big hit. Just ask my siblings.

Also, with a recent friendly challenge to refrain from blogging for aweek, then Spring Break and its accompanying lack of Internet, the placehas felt rather deserted. That is, of course, except for all thewonderful, marvelous, terrific friends wishing me a happy birthday. Youknow who you are. You know how awesome you are.

I drove way more than average over Spring Break. I drove (what feltlike) halfway across the state to visit my sister and her family. Idrove all around town while I was staying with my parents. I took a latenight/early morning excursion to St. Olaf&#x02bc;s Lutheran church to see if itwas really haunted. It is this latter story that I wish to divulgeherein.

I had heard about St. Olaf&#x02bc;s on several occasions previously, but Inever had the chance to visit. I expressed my desire to go during SpringBreak, and after two postponements, several of my friends consented totake me there. We were in two cars. I was following. The lead driverspeeds. We were tearing down the highway at who knows what speed, when Isaw police lights come on behind me. Hooray. I pulled over withanticipation, but the cruiser just zipped right past me and proceeded topull over the lead driver.

That was hilarious. Thankfully, he only got a warning, and we were onour way again. My passenger and I watched the entire show from a nearbygas station parking lot. I then mentioned to my passenger that I hadnever been pulled over before, _ever_, and I really wouldn&#x02bc;t know whatto do if I ever was stopped by the police.

We drove for a while longer, and checked out St. Olaf&#x02bc;s (which requiredsome light trespassingâ€”I&#x02bc;m not proud of that). I decided that thechurch was old, small, well-kept, and anything but haunted. We all droveback to town, and I dropped off my passenger and began my short drivehome.

In a solid residential area, I make a left turn, and out of nowhere Ihave police lights flashing behind me. This time there wasn&#x02bc;t anyone infront of me to pull over. This was _my_ time.

Apparently, I failed to use my turn signal when I took the left turn.Silly me. I got away with nothing but the strict advice, &ldquo;Obey _all_ thelaws tonight.&rdquo;

I can no longer say I have never been pulled over. But I&#x02bc;m stillticketless, and that&#x02bc;s just awesome.

P.S. Thanks, Dad, for keeping me on your insurance, even if the proof ofinsurance card in the car expired seven days ago.
