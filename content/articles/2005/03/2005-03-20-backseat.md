Subtle Coolness has recently taken a backseat to some other projects of mine. Most notably, I just started a website for
my family to keep in touch more easily, and it&#x02bc;s been a big hit. Just ask my siblings.

Also, with a recent friendly challenge to refrain from blogging for a week, then Spring Break and its accompanying lack
of Internet, the place has felt rather deserted. That is, of course, except for all the wonderful, marvelous, terrific
friends wishing me a happy birthday. You know who you are. You know how awesome you are.

I drove way more than average over Spring Break. I drove (what felt like) halfway across the state to visit my sister
and her family. I drove all around town while I was staying with my parents. I took a late night/early morning excursion
to St. Olaf&#x02bc;s Lutheran church to see if it was really haunted. It is this latter story that I wish to divulge
herein.

I had heard about St. Olaf&#x02bc;s on several occasions previously, but I never had the chance to visit. I expressed my
desire to go during Spring Break, and after two postponements, several of my friends consented to take me there. We were
in two cars. I was following. The lead driver speeds. We were tearing down the highway at who knows what speed, when I
saw police lights come on behind me. Hooray. I pulled over with anticipation, but the cruiser just zipped right past me
and proceeded to pull over the lead driver.

That was hilarious. Thankfully, he only got a warning, and we were on our way again. My passenger and I watched the
entire show from a nearby gas station parking lot. I then mentioned to my passenger that I had never been pulled over
before, _ever_, and I really wouldn&#x02bc;t know what to do if I ever was stopped by the police.

We drove for a while longer, and checked out St. Olaf&#x02bc;s (which required some light trespassing &mdash; I&#x02bc;m
not proud of that). I decided that the church was old, small, well-kept, and anything but haunted. We all drove back to
town, and I dropped off my passenger and began my short drive home.

In a solid residential area, I make a left turn, and out of nowhere I have police lights flashing behind me. This time
there wasn&#x02bc;t anyone in front of me to pull over. This was _my_ time.

Apparently, I failed to use my turn signal when I took the left turn. Silly me. I got away with nothing but the strict
advice, &ldquo;Obey _all_ the laws tonight.&rdquo;

I can no longer say I have never been pulled over. But I&#x02bc;m still ticketless, and that&#x02bc;s just awesome.

P.S. Thanks, Dad, for keeping me on your insurance, even if the proof of insurance card in the car expired seven days
ago.
