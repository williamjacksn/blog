Swimming gives me time to think. Today, in the pool, I was thinking aboutwhat I needed to do later his week. I was trying to remember when my examfor Computer Science was, so I could be prepared. I suddenly remembered thatmy Computer Science exam was held last night.

That&#x02bc;s right, I completely forgot about it, and rearranged the furniture inmy apartment instead.

As I write this I am waiting for a response from my professor regardingwhether I can take a makeup exam or not. If you hear a knocking, that&#x02bc;s thesound of my head hitting the wall repeatedly for the next hour.
