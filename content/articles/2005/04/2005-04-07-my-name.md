It&#x02bc;s barely noon, and I have had one exciting day so far. My ComputerScience professor allowed me to take the exam this morning at 09:00, forwhich I will be eternally grateful. Because we had to walk to an emptyroom and get me situated, she gave me until 11:05 to finish.

I didn&#x02bc;t answer everything, but I had to stop at 10:50 so I could go tomy 11:00 Government class and take an exam there. The Government examwas significantly easier, and I finished it in about twenty minutes.Unfortunately, I was boxed in on both sides and didn&#x02bc;t want to disturbthe students around me, so I waited another fifteen or twenty minutesbefore I left.

I&#x02bc;m certain only about 20% of the student in this Government class cometo the lecture every time, so I am always surprised to walk in on a testday to see the hall filled to capacity. This is the second time someonehas taken my seat, too.

Wouldn&#x02bc;t that just frustrate you? Here I am, I come to every class andsit in the same seat every Tuesday and Thursday, and on test day somelazy student who probably never comes to the lecture just moseys on inand sits in my seat like it&#x02bc;s fair game. It was probably only the fourthtime she&#x02bc;s been in that hall all semester, no doubt.

At least I remembered to take the test.
