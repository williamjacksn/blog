One week ago, on 4 April 2005, I parked my best friend&#x02bc;s car outside hisdorm. I remember it like it was only last week. It was 17:45, the veryminute those particular parking spots change from permit-only toanyone-can-park-there.

I began walking towards the swimming center, and I called the aforementionedbest friend to inform him concerning the whereabouts of his car. I left itthere because I would not be going to Family Home Evening with him. All waswell, the swimming was great, and the FHE that I _did_ go to was fun, too.

Later that evening, I was waiting for my friend to come to my apartment so Icould drive him home. My phone rang. It was him.

&ldquo;He&#x02bc;s close,&rdquo; I thought. He always calls when he is close.

He actually called to tell me that I got a parking ticket. Unbelievable. Theviolation: &ldquo;Parking a motor vehicle in an unauthorized are without a validpermit.&rdquo; The time on the ticket: 17:45. Un-_freaking_-believable.

What parking attendant dares give me a ticket at the exact minute the areabecomes free game, and on the fourth anniversary to the day of the firsttime I ever donated blood? Seriously. This ticket had disrespect smeared allover it.

My best friend told me to appeal it; my roommate told me to appeal it; Iknew the whole time I was going to appeal it. I appealed it.

This morning I received an email from Parking &amp; Transportation Services.

You&#x02bc;re darned right the citation is void. Thanks for that link on how toavoid citations, as well. I could have used that a week ago.

In closing, I completely beat the system, and my sister would be so proud ofme.
