What did I learn in Boy Scouts? &ldquo;Be Prepared.&rdquo; I guess I didn&#x02bc;t listen.

Yesterday at about 12:30 I was invited to join a small group of friends to see the Broadway Musical _Thoroughly Modern Millie_ at Bass Concert Hall. I admit, I didn&#x02bc;t know it was a Broadway Musical when I accepted the invitation.

Anyway, I met two friends at the box office later that day to buy my ticket. They each bought a ticket for someone who wasn&#x02bc;t there, but I hadn&#x02bc;t said anything to anyone, so I just bought one ticket for myself. My friends told me that I should buy two tickets and get someone else to go, but I didn&#x02bc;t.

That evening at the Institute I saw ChloÃ« for the first time in several weeks. I asked her if she wanted to see the show with me, and she agreed. At this point, I was wishing I had bought that other ticket as my friends had suggested, but I wasn&#x02bc;t worried that the show would be sold out.

Okay, I was worried that I wouldn&#x02bc;t be able to get another ticket right next to the seat I already paid for. But everything turned out alright in the end.

As for the show, it was amazing! You must see it. Lucky for you (_family, nudge nudge_), the show is [coming to Salt Lake City](http://www.modernmillietour.com/tourlocations.php#SALT%20LAKE%20CITY) later this month. Sarah, I know you will love it.

Without spoiling anything, _Thoroughly Modern Millie_ is the story of a young Kansas girl that moves to New York City in the 1920s to begin her life as &ldquo;the modern woman&rdquo;. If you like tap dancing stenographers in bright orange stockings, or if you don&#x02bc;t, you must see this show.
