I love a twist in my morning routine. After my email reading, showering,dressing, and breakfasting, said twist arrived. Said twist arrived in theform of a siren that came down my street and stopped right outside mywindow.

Sadly, I didn&#x02bc;t even get to see what was going on. There wasn&#x02bc;t a fireanywhere. I didn&#x02bc;t see any automobile accidents. It was kind ofdisappointing.

Just listen to me, getting disappointed because there were no disastersoutside my home this morning.
