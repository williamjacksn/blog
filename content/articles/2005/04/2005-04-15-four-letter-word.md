This morning I reminded myself what it feels like to turn off my alarmand get back in bed. Then I reminded myself what it feels like to joltout of bed two hours later with a sick sensation in my gut. Then Ireminded myself what it feels like to call my supervisor to tell her Iwould be late to work. Then I reminded myself what it feels like to rushto work without taking a shower.

Resplendent; aghast; abashed; icky.

Today I feel icky. I didn&#x02bc;t take a shower, therefore I didn&#x02bc;t wash myhair, and it looks and feels icky. I went to bed without taking off myLivestrong bracelet, and I&#x02bc;m still wearing it. That&#x02bc;s just icky. I woresandals to save time, and my feet feel icky.

In my dream this morning I kept a crab in my pocket.

I&#x02bc;m icky at work. I&#x02bc;ll probably go to Friday Forum feeling icky, Iwanted to get my hair cut after that, but it&#x02bc;s not clean so those plansare out the window.

I hate feeling icky.
