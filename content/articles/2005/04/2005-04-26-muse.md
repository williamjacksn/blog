Here&#x02bc;s the transcript of part of an instant messenger conversation I just had:

She&#x02bc;s been bugging me about going to this concert for a while now, and I was afraid it was going to conflict with a graduation party I will be attending, but today I found out that it won&#x02bc;t. So I&#x02bc;m going. To both.

Sometimes, peer pressure just _works_.
