Yesterday was my mother&#x02bc;s birthday. She turned 29 again.

One of my brothers was flying into town last night, so when my parentscame down to pick him up, the four of us went to dinner together.

We had a fun time finding the place, because we didn&#x02bc;t decide where wewanted to go until after we left the airport, and I was givingdirections. I _am_ the guy who has lived in this town for several yearsnow. I should know my way around.

That would be true if I owned a car.

Luckily, I had been to this restaurant just last week, so I had a goodidea of which way to go. We just needed to find a road that crossed theriver.

There were plenty of emergency vehicles around, too, and I&#x02bc;m not surewhy.

My twin brother and I ordered the same thing, in unison: fish and chips.I hadn&#x02bc;t seen him since last summer. Mom got the sampler. Dad got thesalmon. Our waiter guessed it was my mother&#x02bc;s birthday and brought usfree dessert.

After dinner we stopped at my apartment, where I gave my mother someflowers, a card, and a finger-painting I did for her. Then my parentsand brother left for home, and I stayed up entirely too late playinga video game.
