My friends, in this digital age where peer pressure, WPMs and Internettrends reign supreme, you need guts to stand for grammatical correctness.

1.   Learn and use correct grammar when you type. If you must, find out about&ldquo;spell checking&rdquo;. You didn&#x02bc;t take English every single year of yourprimary and secondary education for nothing. A person who knows how touse the language and isn&#x02bc;t afraid to do so is attractive.
2.   Read what you typed before you press &ldquo;Enter&rdquo;. When you don&#x02bc;t, more oftenthan not you will really wish you did.
3.   Sentence fragments have their place. Like right here. Use them wisely.
4.   Your &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; key is not broken. Capitalize on that. The more you use it,the stronger your pinky fingers will become. Think how much more yourpromises will mean to others when you make them with strong pinkies.
5.   Punctuation is part of the alphabet, too. Semicolons get lonely; includethem every once in a while.

I may not have a large vocabulary, but I will proudly discriminate againstthe words &ldquo;u&rdquo;, &ldquo;r&rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo; and &ldquo;lol&rdquo;.

Sometimes [songs](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail89.html) can help you remember grammar rules. All these songsare taken from the album _Strong Bad&#x02bc;s Rhythm N&#x02bc; Grammar_.
