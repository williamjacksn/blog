Dear S.,

I was particularly pleased with the first image I scanned: the one you asked about. Unfortunately, I didn&#x02bc;t save it. Today I re-scanned my initials to give you the closer look you requested.

Honestly, I don&#x02bc;t think I did as well. I only had a pencil available to me today, and the original was done in felt-tipped pen. My handwriting also changes from day to day, depending on my mood.

In summary, I find it strange that I feel disappointed with my own initials, but that is, indeed, how I feel.

I remain

Your loving brother,W.
