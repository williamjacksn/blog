It almost lasted a year.

On 18 May 2004, I went to County Line Barbecue with Chloë and some friends. To begin the evening, she gave me this charm.

It was a little inside joke, really. Earlier, we were at some department store, looking at those cute purses with letters on them. I assume, for example, that if your name is &ldquo;Chloë&rdquo;, you would get a purse with the letter &ldquo;C&rdquo; on it. I realized that I hadn&#x02bc;t seen any purses sporting the letter &ldquo;W&rdquo;, and I mentioned this to Chloë. We spent the next ten minutes scouring the shelves, but our search was fruitless.

I have empathy for the Wilmas, Wandas, Wendys, Whitneys, Winifreds, Wrens and Wynonas that can&#x02bc;t buy a purse with their initial on it.

So, Chloë found this charm at [Claire&#x02bc;s](http://www.claires.com/) and gave it to me. The other girl that was going to dinner with us said, &ldquo;It&#x02bc;s from Claire&#x02bc;s, so it will be broken in two weeks.&rdquo;

Three hundred fifty-four days later, the gem broke off in my pocket.
