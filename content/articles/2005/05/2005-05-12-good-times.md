It&#x02bc;s official: [the good times are over](http://homestarrunner.com/buginmouth.html).

I just completed my final final. I hated it. Now the semester is over.Now all I have to look forward to is the lab and my apartment.

The good times will now be replaced by better times.

I&#x02bc;m really going to enjoy visiting my family this summer. This pastsemester has been the semester of connectivity. I was in contact withmore of my siblings more often over the last five months than in theprevious two years, total. I think.

I have the Internet to thank for that. I love technology; but not asmuch as you, you see; but I still love technology.

Always and forever.
