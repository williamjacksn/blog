I&#x02bc;d like to derive a superficial formula that can be used to measurecoolness. It will be simple and straightforward, with no ambiguity.

What I need from everyone, therefore, are ideas. I need to know what youthink should factor into this equation. Everything must be able to beconcretely measured without dispute. Here is an example to inspire you:

![f^r_{fb} - (2 \times f^i_{fb})](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f8o2t5ujx7otwpa/20050513-eqn1.png)

where ![f^r_{fb}](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/m33t6sfwbo77zrc/20050513-eqn2.png) is the number of real friends you have on the[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), and ![f^i_{fb}](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/08qa7cj2ovof4si/20050513-eqn3.png) is the number of imaginary friendsyou have on the [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), e.g. Strong Sad.

I&#x02bc;m considering adding a hefty penalty if you _own_ an imaginary identity onthe [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/).

Remember, this will only be funny if we make this as superficial aspossible. I know you have it in you.
