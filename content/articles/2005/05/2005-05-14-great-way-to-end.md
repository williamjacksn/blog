Last night I had dinner and fun with a good group of people. We ate burritos, and you all know [how much I love
tortillas][a]. Before dinner, though, we were chatting, getting to know each other, and generally having an amusing
conversation.

We discussed Cookie Monster, and how he needs a new name, now that [he doesn&#x02bc;t exclusively eat cookies
anymore][b].

&ldquo;We&#x02bc;ll call him Harold,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;because Grover is already taken.&rdquo;

&ldquo;By who?&rdquo; the girl across the room asked. I couldn&#x02bc;t believe my ears.

&ldquo;By Grover,&rdquo; I replied, with all seriousness. I think I might have been slightly glaring when I said that,
considering the look she gave me, but it was absolutely hilarious.

After dinner we began preparations for &ldquo;the festivities&rdquo;. We were filling little balloons with powdered dye,
then adding water, to make paint-water bombs. We also mixed up a few gallons of pudding.

One girl &mdash; coincidentally, the same one from the Grover episode &mdash; was particularly good at getting the
powder in the balloons. She mentioned that she grew up in Argentina, and I put two and two together. As a baby she was
kidnapped by a South American drug lord, and all her life she smuggled cocaine by stuffing balloons then swallowing
them.

She did slip into a suspicious Hispanic accent from time to time.

When the balloons were ready, we rolled out a bunch of butcher paper and painted on it with pudding with our feet. Of
course, that got a bit out of hand, and a significant amount of pudding ended up on bodies instead of paper.

Finally, the balloons came out. This was a standard water balloon battle, augmented by the fact that all our clothes
were permanently dyed red and green at the end.

Luckily, there was a swimming pool at the apartment complex we were using as our battlefield, so most of us jumped in to
wash ourselves off. I can&#x02bc;t remember the last time I jumped in a swimming pool with all my clothes on.

When everything settled down, we spent the rest of the evening determining what color each other&#x02bc;s mind was, and
reading Chinese silverware writing.

The whole night was totally awesome.
