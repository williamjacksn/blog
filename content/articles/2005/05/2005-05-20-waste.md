I saw _Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith_ Thursday night, but Ican&#x02bc;t make any comments until I know everyone has seen it already. Idon&#x02bc;t want to spoil anything for you.

What with school being out, I have been doing a lot of sitting aroundrecently. For the record, I completed _Metroid Prime 2: Echoes_ on theGameCube. I wasted almost 24 hours of my life on that game. Way to go,William.

Continuing in the video game department, I&#x02bc;ve been halfway through_Final Fantasy VII_ for about six months now. I haven&#x02bc;t touch the gamein that time. I just got bored with it.

A friend just let me borrow _Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force_, and Istarted on it this morning. It&#x02bc;s a first-person shooter, just like_Doom_ or _Goldeneye_ or _Metroid Prime_. As such, it&#x02bc;s already quiterepetitive: point, shoot, point, shoot, strafe, shoot, shoot, crouch,out of ammo, change weapon, point, shoot. You get the idea.

My ultimate summer plans are not solid yet, but I will report on them assoon as I know myself what they will be.
