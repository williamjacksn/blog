Today I plan to go to the computer lab as an employee for the last time.School is out, all of my dorm-based friends are gone, and in preparationfor my triumphant return to my parents&#x02bc; house, today will be my last dayof work.

Maybe.

Yesterday was _supposed_ to be my last day of work, but one of mysupervisors came to talk to me while I was on my shift. She said Ineeded to mentor someone and teach him how to mentor. There are only twoproctors that have mentored anyone for the last semester, and both of usare leaving next week.

I agreed to come in this morning to get the job done. Then I will havecompleted my employment. This is an historic moment.

On Tuesday, I worked in the morning, then ate food and watched twomovies at my apartment all alone. That is such a sad existence. OnWednesday I couldn&#x02bc;t handle the same thing all over again, so I calleda friend and we went to the gym.

Then another friend called me and we went to the mall. _That_ was anadventure. I understand why girls take other girls when they go shoppingfor clothes. The only opinions a man is good for are, &ldquo;That looks goodon you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You look hot.&rdquo;
