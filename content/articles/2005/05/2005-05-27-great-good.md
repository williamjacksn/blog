What with school being over, and my employment terminated, I have beenwasting time watching movies. These are the films I have watched in thelast five days:

*   [_Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/)  
    I&#x02bc;ve already seen it twice. It is so much better than Episodes I andII. It&#x02bc;s hard for me to decide who is more evil: Palpatine orAnakin.
*   [_Swing Kids_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108265/)  
    I&#x02bc;ve seen this one before, but it was a while ago so I wanted toremind myself. It&#x02bc;s sad, like most World War II films are, but themusic is really good.
*   [_Monsters, Inc._](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/)  
    I finally got to watch it. I loved it. I actually found it verytouching, the way Sully and Boo form their relationship. I justabout cried on the last scene when Sully goes through the door, andwe hear Boo&#x02bc;s voice.
*   [_The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/)  
    I remember watching this bad boy in the theatre on opening night.This time I watched the extended version. It&#x02bc;s four hours long! Thatwas the most surprising part about it. All the goodbyes at the endmake me sad.
*   [_A Knight&#x02bc;s Tale_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183790/)There were a few good lines in this movie. Paul Bettany was funny,but did he have to be naked so much?

I&#x02bc;ll probably watch more tomorrow. I should go to the gym again.

At least I had a great conversation with a good friend today. Or was ita _good_ conversation with a _great_ friend? Oh yes, it was a [grood](http://homestarrunner.com/tgs4.html)conversation with a [grood](http://homestarrunner.com/tgs4.html) friend. We talked about religion andrelationships and coffee, among other things. Yep, coffee is still badfor you.
