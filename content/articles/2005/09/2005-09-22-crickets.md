On my way from the Texas Memorial Museum to the Music building, myfriend pointed out a cricket on the sidewalk. &ldquo;Kick it!&rdquo; he said.

&ldquo;No way,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&#x02bc;s really cruel.&rdquo;

Five steps later, we turned around just in time to see a bird swoop downand eat the cricket to death.
