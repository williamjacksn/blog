Yesterday I had two new experiences: I watched a Chinese movie and ended up absolutely disliking it; and I played a full game of _Magic: The Gathering_.

I started watching [_House of Flying Daggers_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0385004/) this morning at 07:00. The costumes were beautiful and the scenery was spectacular. The cinematography was stunning and the fighting was intense. There were even guys flying through a bamboo forest.

I even thought the plot was alright, until it twisted. And twist it did.

Without going into too much detail, one guy tells a girl he loves her, and when he learns that she doesn&#x02bc;t love him back, he proceeds to try to take advantage of her. Later on down the line he ends up murdering her and blaming it on the guy she&#x02bc;s really in love with.

Oh yeah, that&#x02bc;s classy, and he&#x02bc;s supposed to be the guy with _morals_, fighting against a corrupt government. Get your own corrupted ducks in a row, Leo, before you start claiming to stand for ideals.

Wow. I don&#x02bc;t think I&#x02bc;ve ever been so outspoken about some dumb movie before. Enough of that. On to bigger, better, more exciting and way more social things.

Yesterday I played my first game of _Magic: The Gathering_! I discovered that it might be something I could get into, as long as I always play against This One Tall Guy &mdash; from now on, his name will be abbreviated to `Vatican.dll`.

First of all, I had never played before. During the game we both had little rule-books to refer to. I probably checked mine every time either one of us tried to do anything until about halfway through the game.

Next of all, `Vatican.dll` had a big ol&#x02bc; box full of cards and we had to select our own deck out of the mix. I had never played the game and I had to pick what I wanted to fight with. Can you say, &ldquo;unfair advantage&rdquo;? That&#x02bc;s not true, though. `Vatican.dll` found some wicked-awesome cards for me and was a great help as I was selecting my deck.

After that of all, not only were we wizard-dueling each other (that&#x02bc;s what _Magic_ is all about: wizards dueling), but we had to constantly fend off a six-years-old boy who was trying to give us playing tips and look at our cards. I&#x02bc;m pretty sure he even tried to stack my deck in my favor at one point, though he denies it.

All of all, the game was good. I thought I was going to lose for a while because I kept making dumb mistakes. It was my first time after all, and `Vatican.dll` had a couple of annoying [Saproling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=elvish+farmer&amp;Field_Name=on) [factories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=hand+of+justice&amp;Field_Name=on) that kept churning out little minions. Fortunately, I had [some](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=prodigal+sorcerer&amp;Field_Name=on) [Ã¼ber-powerful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=fountain+of+youth&amp;Field_Name=on) [cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=night+soil&amp;Field_Name=on) out and about, and I held on to the last and won.

Was there ever a _Magic: The Gathering_ Saturday morning cartoon show? I might actually enjoy watching it now. Once.
