Saturday, 15 October was the Halloween Dance at the LDS Institute. Itfelt a little early in the month for costumes, but I couldn&#x02bc;t resist. Idressed up as my hero, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

This year I was more specific than I have ever been. I was Obi-WanKenobi as played by Ewan McGregor in _Episode III: Revenge of the Sith_.I started growing a beard three weeks in advance. I studied countlesspictures so I could part my hair in the right place.

All my preparation paid off. I won the prize for &ldquo;most authenticcostume&rdquo; at the dance. I was freaking elated. And I got a Snickers.

The best part is that I get to do it again on the 31st.
