This evening marks the third time I have had the privilege of listening to [Death Cab for Cutie][a] play live at
[Stubb&#x02bc;s][b].

The first instance fell on 28 April 2004. I didn&#x02bc;t go to the concert, but Colleen called me from the concert and
I heard Death Cab live for the first time over a cell phone.

The second chance I had to hear, nay, _experience_ this fine band, was 30 October 2004. This time I was at the concert
in person. Colleen was there,too. [It was incredible][c].

Death Cab concert number three came tonight. I wasn&#x02bc;t even expecting it. I knew they were playing, I knew some of
my friends would be there, but I just wasn&#x02bc;t in the mood to fork out the dough this year. I was playing [_Star
Wars: Republic Commando_][d] when I answered my phone and heard a familiar band playing on the other end.

It was so cool to hear Death Cab live again, even if the sound quality sucked. I also felt some unidentifiable emotion
&mdash; a strange sort of disappointment, as far as I could tell &mdash; because it wasn&#x02bc;t Colleen calling me
from the concert. It was Christine, and she&#x02bc;s every bit as cool, but me and Death Cab for Cutie and
Stubb&#x02bc;s and Colleen have a history.

And somehow that makes a difference.
