I went to see _Macbeth_ tonight, for two reasons, in chronologicalorder.

First, ChloÃ« invited me. Who can resist?

Second, Natalie is Lady Macbeth. When I first decided to go, I had noidea. She played the evil woman very convincingly.

Everything was so awesome. I think Shakespeare is way better than anylive music Austin may have to offer.
