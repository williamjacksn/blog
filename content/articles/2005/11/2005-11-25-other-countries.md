I have been given permission to be Taiwanese. It&#x02bc;s convenient to be from a foreign country. You can go wherever you want, and if the security gentlemen confront you, you can just pretend you can&#x02bc;t speak English. I&#x02bc;ll be trespassing on way more golf courses in the foreseeable future.
