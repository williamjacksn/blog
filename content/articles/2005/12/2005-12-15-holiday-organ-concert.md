I had originally planned to go to the [Trail of Lights](http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/tol/default.htm) with my wardtonight, but Michael Perrone called andoffered me a ticket to John Longhurst&#x02bc;s holiday organ concert. I decidedthat if I had seen the Trail of Lights once I had seen it a milliontimes, and I could very well get some friends together and walk aroundin the cold and the dark for forty-five minutes any other day thismonth. So I went to the concert, with Michael and Theresa Jordan and Mariah Campbell.

[John Longhurst](http://www.mormontabernaclechoir.org/info/person?person_id=18) is a cool guy. He basically owns the organ in theTabernacle at Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah. Yeah, he&#x02bc;s reallygood. My favorite part was when he played _Angels We Have Heard on High_and everyone in the hall (except the people sitting next to us) sangalong. We also sang _Silent Night_ with a harp and some percussion laterin the concert.
