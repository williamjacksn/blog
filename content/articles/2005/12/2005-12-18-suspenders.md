I have some cool suspenders that I will be wearing to church today. I used to only wear them under my shirts to keep too-big pants from falling off me. Then I performed in [Gilbert and Sullivan](http://gilbertsullivan.org/)&#x02bc;s _Trial by Jury_. Suspenders and a bow tie were part of my costume.

I decided the suspenders could be incorporated into my civilian wardrobe. I&#x02bc;m still not sure about wearing a bow tie to church, even though I have seen other people do it. Well, I&#x02bc;ve seen _one_ other person do it.
