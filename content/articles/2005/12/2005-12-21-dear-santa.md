Mr. Santa Claus  
North Pole  
Canada

Dear Mr. Claus,

I hope you receive this letter. You&#x02bc;re not the type of guy that&#x02bc;s easyto get in touch with. I&#x02bc;m still not sure if you fall in the jurisdictionof Canada, but I&#x02bc;m sure the postal service there will oblige me bydelivering this letter.

It has come to my attention that, due to the increasing world population, youhaven&#x02bc;t been able to keep track of the naughty/nice status of severalpeople in my area. Just in case I am one of them, I wanted to make sureyou got all the details.

I should begin my pointing out how good I have been recently in eatingmy vegetables. I&#x02bc;ve got a bag of broccoli in the freezer that I havebeen working on, and I always get lettuce on my hamburgers at Wendy&#x02bc;s.Mom would be proud of me. I hope you are, too.

This year was incredible when it comes to not beating up on my siblings.That&#x02bc;s got to count for something. I even said some nice things to themon their birthdays, if I remembered them.

I always paid my phone bill on time, and I was never behind on my rent.That&#x02bc;s pretty good for a poor college student, don&#x02bc;t you think? I evenattended most of my lectures, especially the 8:00am ones. I&#x02bc;m not goingto lie to you: that was tough. I think I deserve some bonus points forthat.

If my current nice levels don&#x02bc;t quite cover the lists I sent you inFebruary, May and November, would you consider an advance on all thegood things I&#x02bc;m going to do next year?

Hoping you bring a little snow with you this time,  
William
