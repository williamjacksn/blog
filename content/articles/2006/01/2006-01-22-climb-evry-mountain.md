Last Friday night I went to a birthday party for my friend Rebecca. It was a _Sound of Music_ sing-along. Just as the
Reverend Mother was about to bust out with &ldquo;climb ev&#x02bc;ry mountain,&rdquo; someone made the comment that she
is really wise, like Yoda.

So I start singing &ldquo;climb ev&#x02bc;ry mountain&rdquo; in my best Yoda voice. _That_ was funny.

This evening I found myself in conversation with the same Rebecca. We both discovered that the other was an avid viewer
of the television show _Square One_. I was laughing my head off as she would describe an episode to me, and I would know
exactly what she was talking about.

Then I found out she has Bloomsbury copies of all the _Harry Potter_ books. That just seals the deal. One day I&#x02bc;m
going to own the _Harry Potter_ book set, and I&#x02bc;m going to own the ones that were published in England.

I feel so much cooler about my nerdiness now.
