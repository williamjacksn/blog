I like to sing. I have many friends that also like to sing.

I am a student at the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://mormon.org/)[Institute of Religion](http://www.lds.org/institutes/home/0,8473,768-1-36-60505,00.html) in Austin. I have many friends that are alsostudents here.

When you put these two together, you get something called the Institutechoir. We&#x02bc;ve got everything we need.

Except for a director.

If you want to direct our choir every Tuesday night from 6:00 to 7:30,let me know. I&#x02bc;ll love you forever.
