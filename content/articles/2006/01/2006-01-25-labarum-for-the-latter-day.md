My friend Colleen is a radio star! She hosts &mdash; well, she co-hosts &mdash; a show called [Labarum for the Latter
Day][a]. It&#x02bc;s about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (those [Mormons][b]). She and her lovely
co-host talk about beliefs, and play music by Mormon bands. It&#x02bc;s cool, and you should listen!
