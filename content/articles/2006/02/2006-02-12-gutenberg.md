Gutenberg is a visual theme I developed for Wordpress. I wrote thecode all by myself, but there was a bit of inspiration from aLiveJournal style called &ldquo;A Novel Conundrum&rdquo;.

It&#x02bc;s very basic. Black text on white background, one column, very muchlike the old printed page. My favorite part is the little diddle imagethat separates sections.

I thought Gutenberg was how I wanted my site to look, but one day Irealized that I like colors way too much.
