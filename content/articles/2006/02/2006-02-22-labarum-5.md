Oh my crap! I got to be on the show! Anna wasn&#x02bc;t there so I was the &ldquo;guest co-host&rdquo; with Colleen. We
talked about prophets and why they are so cool. I was a little nervous going in but it was cool in the end.

This week&#x02bc;s featured artist was [Shawn Pittman][a].

Unfortunately, my bright idea didn&#x02bc;t work and I didn&#x02bc;t get a recording this week. I think I have it
figured out now.
