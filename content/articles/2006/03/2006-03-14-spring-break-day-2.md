Today&#x02bc;s round of yard work was particularly nice. I used the edger &mdash;some call it a &ldquo;weed-whacker&rdquo;, but that sounds uncivilized &mdash; to fightback the advancing grass on one side of the driveway. I was telling Momabout how I thought this activity matched my personality well. There isa nice straight line at the edge of the concrete, and the grass muststay off the line. The boundaries are distinctly drawn. I like that.

After work, Mom got to go give some meaningful service somewhere, so Iwas in charge of taking my younger brothers to the cinema. First, Iunderestimated the popularity of the dollar-theater during spring break.Second, I underestimated the running time of _Harry Potter and theGoblet of Fire_.

The line for tickets was long. Matthew wanted to watch _Chicken Little_.Mark didn&#x02bc;t. Mark watched _Harry Potter_ while Matthew and I watched_Chicken Little_. When our film was over (including all the credits), Ipoked my head into Mark&#x02bc;s theater just in time to see the four Triwizardchampions barely starting on the second task.

There was no way Mark&#x02bc;s fifty cents was going to buy him more screentime than me, so I watched the rest of _Potter_, too. Good film, that.

And then there was video games.
