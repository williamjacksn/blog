Mom got to once again perform some meaningful service elsewhere, butthis time it was in the morning, so I was left in charge of my twoshorter brothers during the yard work. I&#x02bc;m such a lenient taskmaster,though, and Matthew and Mark were incredibly helpful. We finished allthe work we needed to do today before Dad left for work.

When Mom got back she decided that we needed to clean the garage. Thatwas a great idea. We moved some things around and got rid of some trash,and cleaned up so much we were able to fit a car in.

Only someone who has lived at my house can really appreciate the factthat we actually put a car inside our garage. That happens maybe onceevery five years. Maybe.

_Yes_, the garage door closes with the car inside.
