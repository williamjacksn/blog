You&#x02bc;ll never guess what I did today. I dug holes again.

Mom went to the temple in Dallas today. She left before I was out ofbed. The yard work challenge of the day was to remove a tree from theback yard and replant it in the front yard.

The first hole Matthew, Mark and I dug was the original tree position.It wasn&#x02bc;t a very big tree, but we had to dig around roots, and that madeit difficult.

Hole number 2 was the first candidate for the new location of the tree.Unfortunately, I uncovered a sprinkler pipe. Lucky me. Hole 3 was twofeet away from hole 2, and it was the final resting place of the tree.

All the dirt (and tree) that used to be in hole 1 is now in hole 3. Allof hole 3&#x02bc;s original dirt is in hole 1. Let&#x02bc;s just pretend hole 2 neverexisted.

Then we three \[hole-digging\] kings went to the bowling alley. We are allbowling wizards: Mark scored 92, Matthew scored 136 (by cleverly bowlingthree balls per frame), and I scored 174 with four strikes in a row.
