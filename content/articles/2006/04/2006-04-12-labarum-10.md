Lisa Anderson came on the show and the dynamic trio claimed to talk about Easter, but the conversation went all over the
place. Such as: Easter candy, Kevin Rollins, and the Institute. But they _did_ talk about Easter, and I enjoyed it.

Music by the band Sweet Mountain Music. I can&#x02bc;t find a link.
