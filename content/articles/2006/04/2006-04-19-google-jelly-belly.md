Every time I put a [Jelly Belly](http://jellybelly.com/Cultures/en-US/) Bean in my mouth, I pause. How canthe flavour of popcorn, or cantaloupe, or jalapeno, or strawberrycheesecake be squeezed into such a little bean? And how can the flavoursbe so accurate? Every bean is so wonderful. And colorful.

Google&#x02bc;s web applications are like that. They are colorful. But theyalso cause me to sit back and reflect on how extremely cool, intuitiveand powerful they are.

For the last month or so, I have been looking around for a solution toa problem. The problem: find a web-based calendar. That&#x02bc;s easy to use.That can do recurring appointments. That looks cool. A tall order, Iknow.

I tried a few on my own server, and settled on one, but I wasn&#x02bc;t reallysatisfied. Then Google comes to the rescue.

I am now a very happy user of [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/). It&#x02bc;s beautiful andpowerful and just what I needed, and every time I use it I am remindedof Jelly Belly Beans.

That&#x02bc;s the best kind of web application.
