There isn&#x02bc;t always a price to pay for fun, unless you&#x02bc;re simple like me.

Last Saturday I frolicked with friends over at the lake. Well, it&#x02bc;s actually a river, but it&#x02bc;s been dammed so it counts as a lake. It&#x02bc;s just a very long, narrow lake. And that&#x02bc;s where I was when said frolicking took place.

I tried to slackline. That&#x02bc;s where someone ties a cord between two trees so that it&#x02bc;s really tight, but it&#x02bc;s elastic so it gives when you put weight on it. The idea is to balance your self on it, but I never got that far. According to the guy who was teaching us, I&#x02bc;m too tense.

I dived in. It was cold. I swam around. I got on a boat. I played with a Frisbee in the water. I had a great time. On the way home we &ldquo;hiked&rdquo; Mount Bonnell.

I got sunburned. And I got sunsick. I was expecting the former, because I _always_ get sunburned. But I completely forgot about my sunsickness. Until the morning after.

When I awoke Sunday morning, I felt terrible. I felt sick to my stomach, and generally weak all over, and extremely dehydrated. I had a little headache. I stayed home all day, drinking lots of water. I felt better when I finally got out of bed and had something to eat.

The sunsickness only lasted a day. I&#x02bc;m happy to be feeling much better this morning, but I&#x02bc;m sad that I missed Church yesterday.

And that&#x02bc;s my adventure for the weekend.
