About three weeks ago I [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/)ed a website with a recipe for [apple crumble](http://www.cookingbynumbers.com/Recipe_in_one.asp?RecipeID=6), and tonight I finally got to try making it.

Yeah. I followed the recipe, but it didn&#x02bc;t turn out that good. Well, I used gala apples. That was probably a bad idea.

I need to find some better recipes.
