Today my best friend was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. He invited me to the ceremony. It was really cool. His father, a retired Air Force Major, commissioned him.

That got me to thinking. If I had done ROTC and been commissioned today, could my father have commissioned me?

I always feel something stirring within me when I listen to the National Anthem with my hand over my heart, facing the flag.
