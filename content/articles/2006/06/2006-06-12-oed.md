Dear Cherry,

I completed reading [_The Professor and the Madman_][a] today. It was an excellent book. It changed the way I think
about dictionaries and their use.

[a]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Surgeon_of_Crowthorne

First, while I was still reading it, I looked up information about the [OED online][b]. I found out that I could
subscribe to access the online version for $295 per year. Wow. Then I realized that my university would probably have a
subscription already, so I investigated.

[b]: https://www.oed.com/

Sure enough, I can access the OED online through my university&#x02bc;s [library website][c]. This made me very happy.
As in, as long as I am affiliated with the University of Texas, I will never use any other online dictionary again.
Ever.

Second, my perception of the purpose of a dictionary has fundamentally changed. I am reminded of [some things I wrote
recently][d] regarding &lsquo;florescent&rsquo; and &lsquo;fluorescent&rsquo;, for example. I used to think that it was
the dictionary&#x02bc;s job to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; the language &mdash; to define the rules of engagement, as it were. I
was under the impression that if one used a word in violation of its stated definition, one used the word incorrectly.
Period.

Now I understand: the dictionary is not scripture; it is merely history. While it does its best to accurately describe
what a word _means_, its primary purpose is to accurately describe what a word _meant_. The dictionary is a book of
history. It preserves, as best as possible, the history of a language.

The English language is not set. It is a living, evolving thing. It is not &lsquo;fixed&rsquo;, and is there any sane
way to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; it? I submit that there is not.

Lexicographically,

William
