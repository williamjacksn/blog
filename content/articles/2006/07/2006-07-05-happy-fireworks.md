Quite suddenly, I went home to visit my parents on the Fourth of July.Jared picked me up from work Monday evening. We gathered a few things atthe apartment and uneventfully drove to the greater Waco area.

When I got to my house, my sister Heather and her daughter Eva werethere along with my parents and brother Daniel, who had fetched me fromJared&#x02bc;s house. They were popping popcorn. Daniel had left to get me inthe middle of watching [_Mission: Impossible II_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0120755/).

I ate gumbo and watched the rest of _Mission: Impossible II_. The moviekind of sucks because it was directed by [John Woo](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000247/). John Woo is nota bad director, but I don&#x02bc;t like his style in a _Mission: Impossible_movie.

On Independence Day the annual parade came down our street. It&#x02bc;s nice tojust walk out your front door and have candy thrown at you. After theparade Lorraine and Jack and Ellen came over and we ate waffles, lotsand lots of waffles.

And took pictures, lots and lots of pictures.

After a bit of lounging, the manfolk went to the theatre to watch[_Mission: Impossible III_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0317919/). I liked that movie a lot.

In the evening the missionaries came over for dinner (pizza), then Istarted watching [_The Empire Strikes Back_](http://imdb.com/title/tt0080684/). What a wonderfulmovie! Jared came and picked me up to go back to Austin just beforeVader said, &ldquo;No, I am your father.&rdquo; What a wonderful movie.

Even though it was a bit rainy Tuesday evening, we got to see somefireworks from the highway.
