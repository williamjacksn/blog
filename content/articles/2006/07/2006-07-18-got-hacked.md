I got hacked!

Last night someone took advantage of a vulnerability in some software I use on the site to replace the home page and set some other stuff up. It looks like they were getting ready to redesign my website for me.

Thanks go to Eric for calling me to tell me about this. His site got hacked, too.

Oh, and that bit of software with the vulnerability? It&#x02bc;s gone.
