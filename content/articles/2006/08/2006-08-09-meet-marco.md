When I came home from my vacation in Utah and Idaho,Marco was already a resident in my apartment. Marco isfrom Florida.

I have determined that Marco is a _Pseudemys floridanapeninsularis_, a peninsula cooter. And I think Marco is female.

Some more information: My roommate&#x02bc;s fianc√©e recently wentto Florida on business, and I&#x02bc;m not sure about the details, buteither she or someone else brought me this turtle.

Marco is about 2-3 inches long. I haven&#x02bc;t gotten my ruler out yet.

Someone else named her Marco, because she is from Marco Island,and everyone thought she was a boy because no one knew howto tell if a turtle is male or female.
