I like to eat.

So, I was standing in front of the microwave at work about fifteen minutes ago reading the instructions on the bottom of my frozen lunch. Even though I&#x02bc;ve cooked this kind of frozen lunch a half-dozen times, I was reading the instructions, because that&#x02bc;s what I do.

I&#x02bc;m glad I never have to worry about cooking at high altitudes.

The last step was, &ldquo;Let stand in microwave 1 to 2 minutes.&rdquo;

Yeah, right. I&#x02bc;m hungry and I am _not_ going to wait &ldquo;1 to 2 minutes&rdquo; for my lunch that has already taken four minutes to thaw and cook in that strange machine.
