[&ldquo;Correct me if I&#x02bc;m wrong, but are you asking for a challenge?&rdquo;](http://homestarrunner.com/underconstruction.html)

The challenge is to write a poem that is made up of exactly one hundredcharacters. You are only allowed to use letters of the alphabet; nopunctuation or spaces or numbers or anything of that nature.

Ideally, poems should be submitted as ten lines with ten characters oneach line. Neither the deadline nor method of judging has yet beendetermined, but extra points will be awarded for rhyme, meter, andgeneral cleverness.

There is [an official entry form](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fyqx8r6453cnkcy/20060814-challenge.pdf) if you want to submit your entryby post or distribute the challenge around you school or place of work.That would be just plain cool.
