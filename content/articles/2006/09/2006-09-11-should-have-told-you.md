I should have told you two weeks ago that I saw _The Sound of Music_ onthe big screen.

I should have told you a week ago that I visited my parents over LaborDay Weekend and had my mother cut all the hair off the top of my head.

I should have told you a few hours ago that when I got out of bed Sundaymorning I did not intend to jump on a trampoline, yet later that day Ifound myself doing exactly that. Not only was I jumping on a trampoline,I was doing it while wearing a suit. It was a glorious day.
