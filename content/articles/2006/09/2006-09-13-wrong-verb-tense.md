Classes continued normally at the University of Texas yesterday asanother issue of _The Daily Texan_ was released. Many students wereunaware as they perused the newspaper that they were holding a piece ofjournalistic literature with a flagrant grammatical error on the cover.

&ldquo;Student protesters questions attacks&rdquo; read that day&#x02bc;s front-pageheadline. This discrepancy was discovered by Computer Science seniorWilliam Jackson.

&ldquo;I don&#x02bc;t usually pick up the paper, because I don&#x02bc;t have a birdcage Ihave to keep lined. I got it today because I was planning on doing somefinger-painting later tonight,&rdquo; Jackson explained. &ldquo;I don&#x02bc;t want to getfinger paint all over my carpet.&rdquo;

Jackson continued, &ldquo;I wasn&#x02bc;t even going to read it, but the letters wereso big, the error so blatant, I couldn&#x02bc;t help but notice.&rdquo;

_The Daily Texan_ has a long history: it was first published in 1900 andhas been serving the University of Texas at Austin since then. Jacksonhas had access to the paper since 2000 when he first came to theUniversity.

&ldquo;I never really liked the _Texan_,&rdquo; Jackson explained. &ldquo;What are there,like nine different fonts on the front page alone? It hurts my eyes justto look at it. As far as the grammar is concerned, this is just the kindof journalistic quality I have come to expect from this newspaper.&rdquo;

Jackson recalled another incident that left him questioning thereliability of the _Texan_. &ldquo;I remember another headline from a whileback. It said something like, &lsquo;Montoya says adios, that&#x02bc;s Spanish forgoodbye&rsquo;. Seriously, is that supposed to be funny? Who doesn&#x02bc;t know thatalready?&rdquo;

In defense of the newspaper, the online edition either did not fallvictim to the same error, or it was promptly changed upon discovery.

&ldquo;This is a real blow to my school pride.&rdquo; Jackson concluded. &ldquo;I thoughtthere were some tests you had to pass to get accepted to UT. I&#x02bc;mconsidering applying to be a proofreader for the _Texan_ so I can do mypart to keep this kind of humiliation to a minimum.&rdquo;
