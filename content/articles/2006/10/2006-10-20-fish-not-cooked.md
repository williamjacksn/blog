Tonight I had for-real sushi. Not fake crabmeat sushi from the studentunion, the real deal. It was fish and it was not cooked! And it wasdelicious!

I actually only ate a bit of fish. Most of my dish was eel, which, I amtold, needs to be cooked.

So, if I&#x02bc;m sick tomorrow I will know why.

My friend Jerry and I have developed a tradition for ourselves here inAustin. Every Friday (almost) we go to a new restaurant for dinner andhave an adventure! After dinner we always go to [Amy&#x02bc;s Ice Cream](http://www.amysicecream.com/).

Tonight&#x02bc;s adventure was [Sushi Sak√©](http://sushisakeaustin.com/). The food is better than thewebsite.
