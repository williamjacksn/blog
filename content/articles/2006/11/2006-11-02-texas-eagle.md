On Friday I sang with the UT Men&#x02bc;s Chorus, &ldquo;if that train runs me right, I&#x02bc;ll be home Saturday night.&rdquo; As it turns out, I was home _Friday_ night and I rode in a car with my parents.

Saturday morning found us at the temple in Dallas, and in the evening we went to a Halloween party. My younger brother Mark dressed very convincingly as the Grim Reaper, and my youngest brother Matthew jumped around as Mario (but without the mustache). As for me, I threw on a three-piece suit and sang Sinatra and Jiminy Cricket while serving punch. No foolin&#x02bc;.

David and Chelsea appeared at the party, too. How did they know where we were? They checked the calendar.

Monday evening, to go back to Austin, I actually did ride a train. I did! I had my first American train experience. I&#x02bc;ve ridden many trains, but they were always in England. Trains in England are different than the train I rode on Monday.

First, it was huge. It was huge! The train was as tall as a two-story house. Second, the seats, they were like airplane seats, but wider, and with more leg room. Third, well, how many of you have ridden with Amtrak?

So I was pretty excited about riding the train.
