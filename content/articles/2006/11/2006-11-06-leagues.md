I&#x02bc;m interested in forming a League. You know, a community. A community of all my friends, with a very official sounding name that includes the word &ldquo;League&rdquo;. Like &ldquo;League of Justice&rdquo;, or &ldquo;League of Awesomeness&rdquo;, or &ldquo;League of Me and The Cheat&rdquo;, but all of those are already taken.

Will you help me think of a good name for a League? Because as soon as we have a League we can have an ice cream social.
