Today I went on a tour of the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/). Isaw a lot of computers. The main room that was full of equipment was hotin some places and cool in some places, depending on which row I wasstanding in.

When I&#x02bc;m older, I want a big rack of computers in my closet or mybasement. My website will be a lot faster then.
