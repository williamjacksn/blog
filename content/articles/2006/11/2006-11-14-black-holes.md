I&#x02bc;m here in my Astronomy lecture learning about black holes. I&#x02bc;ve been told some interesting things.

There are three things about a black hole that scientists can measure (in theory): mass, spin, and electric charge. And that&#x02bc;s it. There is no way to tell anything else about a black hole.

There is no way to tell what a black hole is made of. It could be made of hydrogen and helium that used to be part of a star, or it could be made of ice cream. It could be made of photons that can&#x02bc;t get away, or it could be made of puppy dogs that don&#x02bc;t want to leave.

Black holes aren&#x02bc;t very dangerous, unless you really want a closeup look. For example, if the mass of the Sun were compressed until it formed a black hole, and said black hole were placed at the top of the tower at the University of Texas, I could relocate to Round Rock and I would be just fine. Everything within a three kilometer radius of the hole would, unfortunately, be consumed.

In that case, black holes would be made of students, faculty, staff, statues of Civil War heroes, and Spanish-style architecture.
