I&#x02bc;m sorry it had to come to that, but now that I have your attention, I think only a geek of biblical proportions would find this as interesting as I do.

I discovered today that I have a book in my apartment that contains one of the earliest known approximations of π, the ratio of a circle&#x02bc;s circumference to its diameter.

Just open up your nearest Old Testament to [1 Kings 7:23](http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_kgs/7/23#23) and tell me what you see.
