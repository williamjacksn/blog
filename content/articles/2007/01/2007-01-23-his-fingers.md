This movie was made with [iMovie HD][a] on an Apple Mac G5. Total time spent: less than three hours. iMovie has an
incredibly easy learning curve. I can&#x02bc;t wait until I own my very own Apple computer.

I started with the picture selection. Most of them, including the screenshot of my hacked website, I already had on my
(now non-hacked) website, so they were easy to procure. The images I had to generate today were the screen capture of my
non-hacked website &mdash; I don&#x02bc;t know why I didn&#x02bc;t have one already &mdash; and the screen captures of
[Facebook][b] and [MySpace][c].

The background music was obtained with questionable legality, from the [Gnutella][d] network. My client of choice is
[Shareaza][e] on Microsoft Windows.

That was a feat of networking skill worth explaining: I logged in to my home computer using [Remote Desktop
Connection][f], fired up Shareaza, found a suitable file, and downloaded it. I then transferred it to my server not two
feet away (via my home network).

After that, I opened [Fugu][g] on the Mac, connected to my home server and copied the file locally. Finally, I dropped
it into iTunes, and I then could access it in iMovie. What a party.

The voiceover was recorded here in the lab with an inexpensive USB headset. I found out I can&#x02bc;t improvise to a
computer screen, so I typed out everything I wanted to say, then read it.

Throw it all together, tweak the transitions and volume levels a bit &mdash; the music was loud! &mdash; and export it.
Set up an account on [YouTube][h], verify my email address, give it at least one tag (that was annoying), upload it,
wait a few minutes, and here I am.

This was so much fun. I want to make more cheap, cheesy movies.
