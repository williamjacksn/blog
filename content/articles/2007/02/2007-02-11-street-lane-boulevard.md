The first time I can recall trying to use a voice-recognition customer servicesystem over telephone was when I had to activate my installation of Windows XP.It worked okay, but it only asked questions that required &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;no&rdquo;, or anumber as the answer.

I was recently waiting for a bus, and I wanted to know how long I would bewaiting. [Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority](http://www.capmetro.org/) has a voicerecognition system that will give bus schedules. You can also tell it where youare and find out when the next bus will be there.

I gave them a call (the number is on the signs at every bus stop) and begannavigating through the system. For the life of me I couldn&#x02bc;t get it tounderstand that I was standing at the corner of Lamar Blvd. and Braker Ln. Itrecognized &ldquo;lamar&rdquo;, but then asked me if it was &ldquo;street, lane or boulevard&rdquo;. Inever got it to understand that I was saying &ldquo;boulevard&rdquo;.

I kept this up for about fifteen minutes and finally hung up when I saw my buscoming.
