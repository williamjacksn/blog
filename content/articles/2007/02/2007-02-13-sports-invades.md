On Tuesday morning, the sports section of _The Daily Texan_ invaded thefront page, claiming territory once the dominion of local non-sports news.

This coup came unexpectedly, though it appears to have been bloodless,thankfully stemming the tide of &ldquo;what&#x02bc;s black and white and red all over&rdquo;jokes.

The front page has long been the exclusive territory of UT Austin-relatedstories, occasionally commandeered by national or international news ofgeneral interest.

&ldquo;Sports is not of general interest,&rdquo; commented Computer Science seniorWilliam Jackson. &ldquo;Now if this freshman Damion Jones of which the articlespeaks had two heads, _that_ would be of general interest.&rdquo;

It is not known how long this occupation will last. The presence of too manystatistics and foreign words like &ldquo;winningest&rdquo; may produce unrest among thepopulace, forcing sports back to section B from whence it came.
