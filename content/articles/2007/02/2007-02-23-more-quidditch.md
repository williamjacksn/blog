Team Ravenclaw had a strong showing tonight. By the end of the night we werethe only team left with all seven players. But it was long, and tiring, andwe just didn&#x02bc;t have the game in us this time.

It looks like I&#x02bc;ve become full-time keeper, too. Which is fine by me. Whoneeds all that running around anyway?

Also, might I add, I was so happy that my good friends Rebecca and Elizabethjoined our team. They were great chasers. And beaters.
