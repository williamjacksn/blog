The Google Talk Riddle for today is a classic:

>  
> My first doth affliction denote,  
> Which my second is destin&#x02bc;d to feel;And my whole is the best antidote  
> That affliction to soften and heal.

I can&#x02bc;t make this stuff up.

The correct answer came from my friend Justin at 18:42: &ldquo;Woman.&rdquo;

I picked up this riddle from _Emma_ by Jane Austen.
