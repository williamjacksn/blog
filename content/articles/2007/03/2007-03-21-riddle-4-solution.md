As many, many, many of my friends and family pointed out, the only way [to correctly label the jellybean boxes][a] is to
take a single bean from the box labeled &ldquo;Blue &amp; Red Jellybeans.&rdquo;

[a]: {filename}/articles/2007/03/2007-03-19-beans.md

This one was too easy; my cousin Benjamin submitted the correct answer about two hours after the riddle was posted. This
was followed by a flood of correct answers and &ldquo;Did I win?&rdquo; queries.

Ben, I owe you a box of jellybeans.
