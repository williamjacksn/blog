I hope you like math. All you need is math, and maybe a bit of patience to work it out, and this riddle is in the bag.

>  
> I was visiting a friend one evening and remembered that he had three daughters. I asked him how old they were.

> &ldquo;The product of their ages is 72,&rdquo; he answered.

> Quizzically, I asked, &ldquo;Is there anything else you can tell me?&rdquo;
> 
>  
> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the sum of their ages is equal to the number of my house.&rdquo;
> 
>  
> I stepped outside to see what the house number was. Upon returning inside, I said to my host, &ldquo;I&#x02bc;m sorry, but I still can&#x02bc;t figure out their ages.&rdquo;
> 
>  
> He responded apologetically, &ldquo;I&#x02bc;m sorry. I forgot to mention that my oldest daughter likes strawberry shortcake.&rdquo;

With this information, I was able to determine all of their ages. How old is each daughter?

I could really go for some strawberry shortcake myself right now. In fact, Rebecca and I are planning a trip to [Sweet Berry Farm](http://www.sweetberryfarm.com/) very soon, so that strawberry shortcake just might happen.
