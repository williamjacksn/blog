I can only assume the first person with the correct answer was my father. He left enough clues to indicate he knew the
solution, without reporting it directly or giving it away to anyone else. Very clever, Dad.

So, [you want three numbers][a] that multiply to get 72. Here are your options:

[a]: {filename}/articles/2007/03/2007-03-21-riddle-strawberry-shortcake.md

*   2 2 18
*   2 3 12
*   2 4 9
*   2 6 6
*   3 3 8
*   3 4 6

A few loyal riddlers got to this point and gave me some mouth about needing to know the house number. But you really do
not need to know the number. You go look at the house number, but it does not help. But it does! Knowing that the house
number does not help actually helps, because now you can narrow your choices down to sets that have the same sum:

*   2 6 6
*   3 3 8

So what does strawberry shortcake have to do with all of this? Answer: nothing. The last piece of important information
is the existence of _one_ oldest child. Therefore, the ages must be 3, 3, and 8.

In England, house numbering starts at one end of the street at 1 and continues down one side in numerical order (2, 3,
4, &hellip;), then crosses the street and comes back down to the beginning. Therefore, the lowest- and highest-numbered
houses are directly across from each other, and there is no &ldquo;even side&rdquo; of the street.
