So, [the riddle][a] does have a solution. I have just been too lazy to type it here. In fact, the solution was provided
by my friend Noelene just one hour after I posted the riddle:

[a]: {filename}/articles/2007/03/2007-03-30-riddle-6-weighty-matter.md

> you put 3 coins on each side of the scale, leave two off
>  
> if they balance, then use your second weighing to compare the two you left off
>  
> if one of the sets of three is heavier, then compare two of the three coins with your second weighing
>  
> if they balance, then the third one is your counterfeit. if they \[do not\], then the heaver one is your counterfeit
>  
> but really, you should try and spend all eight coins as soon as possible and not worry about which one is fake
