title: Thank you for calling Microsoft, and have a nice day.

In the course of my employment, I occasionally find myself needing to activate a new installation of Windows XP. If the computer in question has a network connection, activation can sometimes be performed over the network. Unfortunately, that rarely works in my situation.

When the activation over the network fails, I get to make a phone call. I have called so many times that I have the number memorized: 1-888-571-2048. This is the Microsoft Product Activation Center.

A few minutes ago I finished a phone call to the Microsoft Product Activation Center. This time, however, is so far and by far the best call I have ever made to India.

That&#x02bc;s right! The Microsoft Product Activation Center is in India. I always suspected this, but today I got it from the proverbial horse&#x02bc;s mouth. That sounds mean. Rahul is not a horse. He is a very considerate man.

As the call begins, I am greeted by a recording that tells me I should try to activate over the network if I have not already tried (thanks, that&#x02bc;s a great idea!), and the average call length is six minutes. Today I brought the average up, because my call lasted 18:55.

About one minute into the call is when I actually start to interact with an automated system. The first question is, &ldquo;Are you calling to activate Windows XP? Please say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo;

You can&#x02bc;t fool me.

I learned a long time ago that voice-recognition systems don&#x02bc;t like me. And I learned a long time ago that at the Microsoft Product Activation Center, &lsquo;1&rsquo; means &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;2&rsquo; means &lsquo;no&rsquo;. So I pressed &lsquo;1&rsquo;.

&ldquo;Are you at your computer with the activation window open?&rdquo;

&ldquo;1.&rdquo;

Eventually I get to give my installation ID, which is a (9 &times; 6 =) 54 digit number that I can either speak or type using the number pad. Just so you know, with a number that long you can uniquely identify one million billion billion billion billion computers. No one ever said Microsoft wasn&#x02bc;t optimistic.

Ideally, after I give my installation ID, the recording thinks for a few seconds &mdash; eerily, I always thought this pause was more for psychological rather than technical reasons &mdash; then gives me a confirmation ID to type in a box in the activation window.

However, that rarely works. The recording apologizes &mdash; a computer is apologizing to me; think about _that_ long and hard &mdash; and informs me that she can&#x02bc;t validate my installation ID. Now I get transferred to a customer service representative. This is where the fun begins.

I first noticed today&#x02bc;s call was different because of the time I had to wait on hold. I seriously listened to the same poor-quality elevator song at least three times, periodically interrupted by, &ldquo;We are experiencing higher-than-normal call volumes.&rdquo; Thanks for the update.

I hope you&#x02bc;re not bored with my story. It&#x02bc;s just getting good.

Finally, I&#x02bc;m on the line with a live person. I give Rahul my installation ID, and as he is looking up my confirmation ID, he asks me the questions I have gotten accustomed to:

&ldquo;Is this software installed on any other computers? Did you buy it separately or did it come pre-installed on the system? What is the make and model of the computer? Where did you buy it?&rdquo;

(About that last question: because I&#x02bc;m working at the Help Desk and never activating Windows on my own computer, I always &ldquo;bought it online.&rdquo;)

Rahul seems satisfied with how the interrogation went, and we are just waiting on that elusive confirmation ID. He tells me his system is slower than normal today. (Hey, I have that problem at home, too!)

If you&#x02bc;ve ever talked to me on the phone, you may be well aware that I don&#x02bc;t mind awkward silence. But Rahul must feel (or have been trained) differently, because after a few seconds of nothing, he tries to strike up a conversation with me to pass the time.

I&#x02bc;m surprised. This has never happened before. But I&#x02bc;m always willing to try new things.

&ldquo;Where are you calling from?&rdquo; he asks.

&ldquo;Texas.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And how is your day?&rdquo;

&ldquo;It&#x02bc;s rainy,&rdquo; I reply. I think this is a great time to confirm my suspicions. &ldquo;Where are you at?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&#x02bc;m in India &mdash; New Delhi.&rdquo;

I smile to myself.

&ldquo;Texas, is that near the coast?&rdquo; Rahul continues.

&ldquo;Well, Texas has a coast, but I don&#x02bc;t live anywhere near it. Do you get monsoon season over there?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, it&#x02bc;s just coming up.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, I hope you stay safe,&rdquo; I say.

A bit more silence. I guess Rahul and I don&#x02bc;t have much in common.

I&#x02bc;m curious, so I ask, &ldquo;Is there any indication of how long this will take, or do we just have to wait it out?&rdquo; I was tempted to add, &ldquo;like a monsoon,&rdquo; but I resisted.

I must have upset Rahul, because he asked if he could put me on hold again. Oh, alright. I hadn&#x02bc;t gotten enough of that song, anyway.

About thirty seconds later, Rahul is back with my confirmation ID and we are about to part ways. Would I ever talk to him again?

&ldquo;It was a pleasure to talk to you, sir,&rdquo; he said to me. &ldquo;Thank you for calling Microsoft, and have a nice day.&rdquo;
