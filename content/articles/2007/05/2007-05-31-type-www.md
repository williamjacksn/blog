I admit that sometimes I go into &ldquo;Help Desk mode&rdquo; without thinking about it. I begin issuing precise, sequential commands and I feel silently indignant when they are not followed accurately.

But when I am working at the Help Desk, Help Desk mode is permanently switched on.

Therefore, don&#x02bc;t type &ldquo;www&rdquo; unless I tell you to type &ldquo;www&rdquo;.
