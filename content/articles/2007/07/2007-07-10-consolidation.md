Until Google releases Socialstream, I will endeavor to collect all my content that I have scattered across the network,
and consolidate it here.

*   The blog, for the moment, is [right here][a]. I am considering moving it to Blogger. But not very seriously.
*   <del>Photographs are at Flickr.</del>
    
    My other option was Picasa Web Albums, but I like a lot of the features Flickr has that Picasa does not. Google
    can&#x02bc;t be the greatest at everything, friend. I am working on moving over any photos I have left on this site.
*   You will find videos at [YouTube][b]. These are few, but available nevertheless. I suppose I could have used Google
    Video, but Google owns both sites anyway. Note to self: if you ever get into making videos more seriously, look into
    [Vimeo][c].
*   <del>I keep my bookmarks at del.icio.us.</del> I think you should, too. At least, your public ones. If you use
    del.icio.us, let me know, so you can be in my network!
*   If you don&#x02bc;t know my email address, here&#x02bc;s a hint: my name is William and my website is
    subtlecoolness.com. If you are my friend on Facebook, you can get my telephone number and a lot of other contact
    information from [my profile page][d].

My master plan is to just fetch everything from those sites and weave it all together here. But all in good time,
friend.
