I was walking across campus on my way from work to choir. I was passing Painter Hall &mdash; home of biology and computer science laboratories. I was strolling along with my bag over my shoulder when I inhaled the unmistakable odor of Malt-O-Meal.

I have no idea where it came from, or if it was, indeed, the Malt-O-Meal I perceived it to be. But that short moment of olfactory sensation triggered a chain of thoughts as I proceeded to the Music building.

I didn&#x02bc;t even eat very much Malt-O-Meal as a kid, yet it is a smell and food product I associate with my childhood. My mother was much more likely to prepare plain old oatmeal. I know I consumed _that_ particular grain in large quantities, especially when it was made into granola &mdash; but that is the subject of a rhetoric session for another day.

I did, however, get my fair share of Malt-O-Meal. To this day I wonder exactly what it is. I remember watching _Annie_ and thinking, when the evil woman who ran orphanage said, &ldquo;You&#x02bc;re not having hot mush today,&rdquo; that surely she was referring to Malt-O-Meal. I imagined that when Oliver Twist held out his bowl and humbly pleaded for &ldquo;more,&rdquo; he was asking for more Malt-O-Meal. Any unidentifiable mixture, not quite solid and not quite soup, was, in my mind, Malt-O-Meal.

I never ate Malt-O-Meal plain. Cinnamon and sugar &mdash; lots and lots of sugar &mdash; was my most frequent flavor. Fresh peaches were exceptionally rare; fresh strawberries even more so.

Today, given a choice, I would probably never buy Malt-O-Meal for myself. Give me oatmeal. Give me bran flakes or corn flakes or puffed wheat. But please don&#x02bc;t give me Malt-O-Meal.

And really, please, don&#x02bc;t give me Grape-Nuts, either. Please.
