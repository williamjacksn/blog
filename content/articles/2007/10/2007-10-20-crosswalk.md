Geoff Yano is my favorite director. I might be a bit biased, because he has directed every film I ever acted in. But he is great! And phenomenal.

Geoff is so phenomenal, in fact, that he recently made a three-minute movie in 24 hours. And it is awesome. The movie, _Crosswalk_, is part of the 2007 Apple Insomnia Film Festival. It&#x02bc;s a contest and normal people like you and like me get to help decide who wins.

So you should click that banner up above and rate Geoff&#x02bc;s movie, because it is really good and deserves to win.

For more detailed instructions on how to register and rate the film, [I refer you to Dan Jones&#x02bc; blog](http://www.goodevilgenius.org/blog/index.php?/archives/12-Vote-for-Crosswalk-in-the-2007-Insomnia-Film-Contest.html).

Please give Geoff a good rating, then tell everyone you know to do the same!
