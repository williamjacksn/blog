True story: I just got on the elevator at the second floor, only to find a custodian wiping down the walls with something lemony-scented. I pushed &ldquo;G&rdquo;, descended two floors, and got out, while said custodian continued to wipe down said walls with said lemony-scented cleaner. No words were spoken.
