Somewhere deep down inside I want to be a photographer. I&#x02bc;m not sure where the desire came from. Perhaps it was because my dad used to have an awesome old 35mm camera that didn&#x02bc;t automatically focus _or_ advance that he would bring out for every birthday in our house? Maybe it was all the time I spent scanning images from my father&#x02bc;s collection of old slides? Could it be because I read some blogs that talk about photography fairly regularly?

Whatever it is, I probably suck at photography right now. Here is a photo I took:

These are some pipes outside one of the School of Architecture buildings at the University of Texas. I took this with a Nokia 6126. Wait, what? That&#x02bc;s right, I took this picture with my cell phone camera. I guess it looks alright, for a cell phone camera.
