I was at church Wednesday night, and I went out into the parking lot, and I saw this parked there:

Even though I have never seen [_The Love Bug_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064603/), [_Herbie Rides Again_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071607/), [_Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076137/), [_Herbie Goes Bananas_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080861/) or [_Herbie Fully Loaded_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400497/) (though I narrowly escaped watching _Herbie Fully Loaded_ once), I think it is cool to see something like this for reals.
