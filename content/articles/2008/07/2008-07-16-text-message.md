So, I have not idea who this came from or what they are talking about. But I love it when someone dials the wrong number. I used to get calls all the time for a different William, but at least that time it was from someone I knew and the other William was also a friend.

The reference to &ldquo;jester&rdquo; lets me know that the message is from someone local. Jester is the name of the biggest dormitory at the University of Texas. I was tempted to play along and send a message back that sounded vaguely like I knew what I was talking about, but I ultimately decided against it.
