Last night was my first camping trip as a Scout leader.

At first I was hesitant to go. I remember camping only reluctantly as a youth. I always preferred a house to a tent. It always rained whenever I camped.

But last night the weather was beautiful and I helped build a fire. After only three hours of the smells and the sounds I wanted to stay, but Rebecca and I already had commitments today so I left early.
