On Saturday Rebecca and I went to [Sweet Berry Farm](http://sweetberryfarm.com/) in Marble Falls, Texas. We got a lift on a hayride to the [Texas Maze](http://goo.gl/maps/LK4Pa). This is a huge &ldquo;hayfield maze&rdquo; shaped like Texas.

The point of the maze is to go in, find nine points that represent the geographical locations of certain Texas cities, and punch a hole in a card with the hole puncher at each point. If one found every city, one got a free drink when one came out.

We probably spent close to an hour searching for cities, and we came out once to consult the map for a few cities that we couldn&#x02bc;t find at first. Rebecca&#x02bc;s mother Ann called me (probably because Rebecca did not have her phone with her) and asked me where we were.

&ldquo;We are lost in a giant maze the shape of Texas,&rdquo; I replied.

With Ann&#x02bc;s well-wishes, we succeeded in the end and Rebecca got her bottle of water and I got my pink lemonade.
