My online creative efforts have been directed elsewhere for some time now. I feel a little sad when I think about what this blog once was, and what it has now become.

But I get over that fairly quickly. On to some announcements:

Most of the news about what is going on recently with my wife and me can be found over at our blog, [Accio Jacksons!](http://acciojacksons.subtlecoolness.com/)

If you can&#x02bc;t get enough of food and cooking blogs, you should subscribe to [My Wife&#x02bc;s Food Blog](http://mywifesfoodblog.wordpress.com/).

My most recent personal programming project fills my need to be reminded of birthdays in a natural and familiar way: in my feed reader! Check out [birthdayfeed](http://birthdayfeed.subtlecoolness.com/) for details.
