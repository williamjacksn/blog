Rebecca and I took our car to the body shop yesterday morning, and rented a [Dodge Caliber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Caliber). Rebecca noticed a &ldquo;Sirius&rdquo; logo near the radio, and wondered if the car really had satellite radio. This morning on the way to work we turned it on to find out.

Yes, our rental car has satellite radio.

This shouldn&#x02bc;t matter much, considering we never &mdash; except when I&#x02bc;m driving somewhere alone, like to Scouts &mdash; turn on our radio in our own car. This morning, however, we listened to [music from the 40s on our rented satellite radio](http://www.siriusxm.com/40son4).
