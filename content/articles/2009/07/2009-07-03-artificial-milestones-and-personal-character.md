This morning Rebecca shared with me [a piece of writing about the challenges and benefits Scouting presents](http://segullah.org/daily-special/scout-mom/) to the Scouts, their leaders, and their parents. It is a tender piece, and reminds me of the importance of my calling as 11-year-old Scout leader.

Without criticizing the piece or [the author](http://magsandmike.blogspot.com/), I wanted to talk about one small line that stuck out at me. Even though Rebecca called my attention to it when she shared the piece with me, I didn&#x02bc;t expect to be affected so much by it.

Last month I attended [the Eagle Court of Honor for my brother Mark](http://mary-jackson.blogspot.com/2009/06/my-brother-mark-is-big-deal.html). I&#x02bc;m proud to have such a hard-working, smart brother, and I&#x02bc;m really happy that I could be there along with several other members of my family.

The thing is, moments like that are fresh reminders to me that, so far, I am the only one of my mother&#x02bc;s six sons that did not earn the rank of Eagle.

Please don&#x02bc;t interpret this as some sort of bitterness or regret. I have wonderful memories of my time as a Scout. I also have some terrible memories; I really did not like camping very much. But overall, I learned and grew so much thanks to the Scouting program. And now I&#x02bc;m a Scout leader, with the opportunity to give &ldquo;the next generation&rdquo; an experience as good as or better than my own.

Earning the rank of Eagle represents real work and dedication. It is usually an indication of a person&#x02bc;s character, and can foreshadow greater accomplishments later in life. But _usually_ is not _always_, and someone who did not earn Eagle is not therefore incapable of having the same caliber of personal character, or accomplishing just as much, if not more.

When making choices about who to spend time with, or be friends with, or date, or marry, it can be detrimental to lay an artificial milestone in someone&#x02bc;s path: &ldquo;I will only marry an Eagle Scout.&rdquo; That&#x02bc;s crazy talk, and unfair to every faithful young man who did not earn Eagle.

It doesn&#x02bc;t stop there. I remember some missionaries (elders) that went home from my mission telling themselves they would only marry a returned missionary sister. That&#x02bc;s crazy talk, and unfair to every faithful young woman that did not choose to serve a mission.

I will be forever thankful that my wife didn&#x02bc;t pass me up because I wasn&#x02bc;t an Eagle Scout. I hope we can teach our children to not judge people by artificial milestones, but by personal character. Eagle Scouts can go bad, and returned missionaries can go inactive. While both achievements are significant and meaningful, they should not be the sole reason to include or exclude someone from the expectation of a life full of happiness, faithfulness, and accomplishment.
