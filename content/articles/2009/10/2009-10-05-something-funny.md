So, my two-year-old nephew walks up to me with a cell phone in his hand and says, &ldquo;Want to see something funny?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I reply.

He then proceeds to spend twenty seconds &mdash; seriously, I counted &mdash; punching buttons on the phone to bring up this funny thing that he wants to show me. He turns the phone display to me and laughs.

I don&#x02bc;t know what is funnier: that my two-year-old nephew is trying to show me something funny on a cell phone; that he pushed buttons for twenty seconds to do it; or that the battery in that phone had been dead for a year.
