Some time ago I signed up to host a Windows 7 Launch Party. The only reason I did that was so I could get a box full of stuff from Microsoft and/or House Party Dot Com. That box came this weekend!

Partly because I want to show you what is inside, and partly because I want to make fun of stereotypical &ldquo;unboxing&rdquo; posts that often appear on tech and gadget blogs around the Internet, I now give you: The Windows 7 Party Pack Unboxing Post Of Flames And Awesomeness, But Not Necessarily Flames.

The box opens:

On the top there are some instructions for making my Windows 7 Party even more awesome than I ever imagined. That is not a Nondisclosure Agreement. And you better believe I didn&#x02bc;t read it, but my party is going to be even more awesome than _you_ ever imagined.

We have streamers:

I plan to use every last inch of streamery goodness to decorate my office.

We have balloons and a deck of cards:

Note how the balloons came in the awesome Microsoft-patented colors &ldquo;Windows Red&rdquo;, &ldquo;Windows Yellow&rdquo;, &ldquo;Windows Green&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Blue Screen of Death&rdquo;. The cards are for gambling on how long it will take to install Windows 7 on your netbook. Or to give you something to do to pass the time.

We have a puzzle:

No party is complete without a puzzle in a convenient resealable bag. Because I will definitely want to save the puzzle and put it together on my own while I am waiting on the Windows 7 install I&#x02bc;ll be doing six months from now. Also, the person who correctly guesses the number of puzzle pieces in the convenient resealable bag wins one of these amazing promotional offers:

Also, did you see the Windows 7 napkins? Those are for cleaning off our faces and hands, because KEEP THE SALSA OFF THE KEYBOARD, MAN!

The prior information I had about what I was going to receive in this box mentioned a &ldquo;Signature Edition&rdquo; of Windows 7 Ultimate, and I wondered that exactly that meant. Well, now I know.

My copy of Windows 7 was signed by Steve Ballmer! The CEO of Microsoft! [&ldquo;Developers, developers, developers!&rdquo;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE) I was hoping for Bill Gates, but I understand he doesn&#x02bc;t work there anymore.

We have a nice big poster:

It features some of the default desktop wallpapers that come with Windows 7. Most of them look really creepy.

Finally, we have tote bags:

Again with the creepy artwork. I don&#x02bc;t know if I want to take this to the grocery store or not. People will think I&#x02bc;m weird. Which I&#x02bc;m not. Even if I _am_ throwing a Windows 7 Launch Party.

Sorry, no flames after all.
