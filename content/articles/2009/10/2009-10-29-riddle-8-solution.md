Jared solved the riddle first:

> light the first rope at both ends and light the second rope at one end. when the first rope has burned up (in 30
> min.), light the other end of the second rope. It will burn up in 15 min. 30 min + 15 min. = 45 min.

Sarah, I&#x02bc;m afraid your solution won&#x02bc;t work, because you are still independently measuring fifteen minutes
somehow. If you had a watch, the entire riddle would be moot.
