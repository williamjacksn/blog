Rebecca recently inherited the following piece of furniture from her grandma:

Do you recognize it? That&#x02bc;s right, it is a Victrola VE 9-18X, built by the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1928. You can read more about it on [the Victor-Victrola Page](http://www.victor-victrola.com/9-18.htm).

I didn&#x02bc;t know what it was when I first looked at it. I assumed it was just a cabinet. When I opened it I noticed the shelves were in strange places, and most of them had holes precisely cut for no apparent reason. Then I found the brass label on the inside of the cabinet, complete with model and serial number.

Unfortunately, all the electronics were pulled out of this cabinet a while ago. But I appreciate that the purpose of the piece is to provide a decorous way to conceal electronic equipment. So I did just that: I used the cabinet to conceal my cable modem and wireless router.
