When I turned two years old I received a [Glo Worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glo_Worm) as a gift. I just learned today that the Glo Worm was first released the same year I was born, making it a fitting gift indeed.

What went through my mind as I hugged my new friend? Did I ever, in my wildest two-year-old dreams, consider that this very scene would be played out with uncanny similarity a quarter of a century later? Certainly not.

Even the green clothes match rather well. I am sure I felt about as much happiness as a two-year-old could feel when I hugged my little Glo Worm. I know I felt the same way when I held little Emily, too.
