I thought it appropriate that today is the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling [Diamond v. Chakrabarty](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3095713882675765791), wherein the Court found that man-made life is patentable.

The man-made life in question was a new species of genetically-engineered bacterium that breaks down crude oil.
