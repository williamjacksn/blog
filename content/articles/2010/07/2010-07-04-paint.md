When we moved into our house over a year ago, our bedroom walls were just some standard, boring white color. We weren&#x02bc;t sure what we wanted to do with them, so we waited.

And waited. And waited.

Then about a month ago, suddenly, Rebecca knew what color she wanted to paint our bedroom. Yesterday we painted the walls in our bedroom [Lyndhurst Gallery Beige](http://www.valspar.com/explore-colors/historic-colors/Lyndhurst%20Colors.html).

The pictures don&#x02bc;t do it justice. You will have to take a closer look the next time you are visiting.
