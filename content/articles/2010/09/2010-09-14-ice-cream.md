We got an ice cream maker from a family that recently moved from ourneighborhood to England. I can understand why. When moving to England, one wouldnot want to take more than one absolutely needs. Also, the plugs are differentover there.

Rebecca identified the model number of the ice cream maker and I found theowner&#x02bc;s manual online.

We decided to start with a recipe for vanilla ice cream. Rebecca procured theingredients. We mixed everything together one fine Friday evening and chilled itin the refrigerator overnight. In the morning we churned it and let it &ldquo;cure&rdquo; inour freezer all day.
