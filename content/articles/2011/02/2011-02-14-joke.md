A physicist, a biologist, and a mathematician are sitting in a street café watching
people entering and leaving the house on the other side of the street. First they see
two people entering the house. Time passes. After a while they notice three people
leaving the house.

The physicist says, &ldquo;The measurement wasn&#x02bc;t accurate.&rdquo;

The biologist says, &ldquo;They must have reproduced.&rdquo;

The mathematician says, &ldquo;If one more person enters the house then it will be
empty.&rdquo;
