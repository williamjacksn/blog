Today Rebecca went to a Women&#x02bc;s Conference at church, so Emily and I wenton a father-daughter date to the park. I invited some other fathers in theneighborhood, but nobody else could make it. But that&#x02bc;s okay!

The last time I took Emily to the park, I tried to find [a geocache](http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=58baf2f0-1d82-4839-bb64-4f81275cce9c). Icouldn&#x02bc;t find it. But I read a few comments by some people that found itin the past, and I decided to try again.

Today Emily and I found it!

We decided to take a walk down to the duck pond to try for another cache. Wewere feeling lucky! Also, Emily really wanted to &ldquo;See ducks!&rdquo; She repeated thatphrase all the way to the pond. Except for when a dog passed us; then it was&ldquo;Hi, dog! Bye dog!&rdquo;

We also saw several bicycles. Emily calls them &ldquo;sickle&rdquo;, and whenever I try totell her to call it a &ldquo;bicycle&rdquo;, she says, &ldquo;Bye bye, sickle!&rdquo;

We made it to the duck pond and we found [the second geocache](http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=037d7249-7d5f-4ef4-9f11-5df74816b4ba), too! We did agood job today.
