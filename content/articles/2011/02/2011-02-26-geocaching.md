Today Rebecca went to a Women&#x02bc;s Conference at church, so Emily and I went on a
father-daughter date to the park. I invited some other fathers in the neighborhood, but
nobody else could make it. But that&#x02bc;s okay!

The last time I took Emily to the park, I tried to find [a geocache][a]. I
couldn&#x02bc;t find it. But I read a few comments by some people that found it in the
past, and I decided to try again.

Today Emily and I found it!

We decided to take a walk down to the duck pond to try for another cache. We were
feeling lucky! Also, Emily really wanted to &ldquo;See ducks!&rdquo; She repeated that
phrase all the way to the pond. Except for when a dog passed us; then it was &ldquo;Hi,
dog! Bye dog!&rdquo;

We also saw several bicycles. Emily calls them &ldquo;sickle&rdquo;, and whenever I try
to tell her to call it a &ldquo;bicycle&rdquo;, she says, &ldquo;Bye bye, sickle!&rdquo;

We made it to the duck pond, and we found [the second geocache][c], too! We did a good
job today.
