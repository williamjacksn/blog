Among other things, Rebecca gave me a pass to go on a [photography fieldtrip](http://www.chimpsy.com/fieldtrips/) for my birthday. I signed up for this morning&#x02bc;s session. Ninestudents and one instructor met at a coffee shop in east Austin with ourpoint-and-shoot cameras, ready to learn.

To begin, Joel, our instructor, introduced us to several features on our camerasand explained how to use them: ISO, exposure compensation, metering, whitebalance, &amp;c. Then he gave us some tips on composing photos: the rule of thirds,creative points-of-view, and perspective lines.

After the instruction, we started walking around and practicing what we learned.Joel was very helpful when I needed clarification or additional help.

I had a lot of fun! I learned a lot and I feel like I have a better idea of howto take much better pictures. These are just a few of the photos I shot today.

I think this next one will make a good desktop background.

The last one is an old telephone pole with no wires that has been taken over bythe local plant life.
