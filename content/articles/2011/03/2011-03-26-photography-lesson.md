Among other things, Rebecca gave me a pass to go on a
[photography field trip](http://www.chimpsy.com/fieldtrips/) for my birthday. I signed
up for this morning&#x02bc;s session. Nine students and one instructor met at a coffee
shop in east Austin with our point-and-shoot cameras, ready to learn.

To begin, Joel, our instructor, introduced us to several features on our cameras and
explained how to use them: ISO, exposure compensation, metering, white balance, &amp;c.
Then he gave us some tips on composing photos: the rule of thirds, creative
points-of-view, and perspective lines.

After the instruction, we started walking around and practicing what we learned. Joel
was very helpful when I needed clarification or additional help.

I had a lot of fun! I learned a lot and I feel like I have a better idea of how to take
much better pictures. These are just a few of the photos I shot today.

I think this next one will make a good desktop background.

The last one is an old telephone pole with no wires that has been taken over by the
local plant life.
