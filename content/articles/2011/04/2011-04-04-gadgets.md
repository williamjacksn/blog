It has been a while (since mid-February, actually) since I got a GPS navigationdevice for my car. This is how I got it.

Sometime near the beginning of the year, I got an advertisement in the mail fora roadside assistance membership called AutoVantage. According to the flyer, ifI joined I would get a free GPS device and the first month of membership wasfree. This offer came through my bank &mdash; I have a credit card from Wells Fargothat I haven&#x02bc;t used in years.

I thought for a moment that this was a scam, but I decided it must be legitimateif Wells Fargo was going to put their name on it. I carefully read the fineprint, filled out the forms, and applied. Worst case scenario: I would be out$15.99 with no GPS device.

Mediocre case scenario: I would end up paying $15.99 for a GPS device thatnormally sells for about $45.

Best case scenario: I would get a free GPS device with no strings attached.

I will tell you right now that the best case scenario transpired. I got the GPSdevice, I cancelled my membership via email without any trouble, and my creditcard statement the following month had a debit of $15.99 shortly followed by acredit of $15.99.

Also I don&#x02bc;t get lost any more when I am trying to get to your house.
