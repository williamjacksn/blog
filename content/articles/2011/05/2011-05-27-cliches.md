The early bird gets the worm. / Good things come to those who wait.

Look before you leap. / He who hesitates is lost.

Two heads are better than one. / If you want something done right, do it yourself.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained. / Better safe than sorry.

Out of sight, out of mind. / Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

You can&#x02bc;t tell a book by its cover. / The clothes make the man.

Many hands make light work. / Too many cooks spoil the broth.

You can&#x02bc;t teach an old dog new tricks. / It&#x02bc;s never too late to learn.

Never sweat the small stuff. / God is in the details.

If at first you don&#x02bc;t succeed, try, try again. / Don&#x02bc;t beat your head against a brick wall.

Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today. / Don&#x02bc;t cross the bridge until you come to it.

More haste less speed. / Time waits for no man.

A word to the wise is sufficient. / Talk is cheap.

Don&#x02bc;t look a gift horse in the mouth. / Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

Hitch your wagon to a star. / Don&#x02bc;t bite off more than you can chew.

The squeaking wheel gets the grease. / Silence is golden.

Birds of a feather flock together. / Opposites attract.

The pen is mightier than the sword. / Actions speak louder than words.
