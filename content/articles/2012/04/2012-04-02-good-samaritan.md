We watched [this video][a] as a family tonight. In one scene, the good Samaritan carries the hurt man in his arms. As I
carried Emily the same way upstairs for her bath, she said, &ldquo;I&#x02bc;m like the hurt man. Are you the good
Samaritan?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I am carrying you like the good Samaritan,&rdquo; I replied. Emily thought for a second,
then asked, &ldquo;Am I the bad Samaritan?&rdquo;
