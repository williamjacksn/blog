For our fifth anniversary my wife made me this nativity advent calendar.

The pieces go in the pockets, and each day of December you take a piece out and build the scene. This is just like a calendar we had in my home growing up.

The craftsmanship here is wonderful, and what amazes me the most is that Rebecca was able to keep it a complete secret from me for months while she worked on it. I really had no idea she was doing this.
