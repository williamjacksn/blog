I have spent enough time on [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/subtlecoolness/) that I have started to see craftyideas everywhere. I was recently at Lowe&#x02bc;s with my three-year-olddaughter Emily when we walked past the paint department. I decided to pick up afew color samples in the hopes that I could do something with them that wouldentertain Emily for a few minutes.

The Christmas season is upon us, so I asked Emily to pick out a green card and ared card. It wasn&#x02bc;t long before I had the idea to make this Christmastree. Cut a triangle out of the green card, the shape of a Christmas tree. Use ahole punch to make ornaments from the red card (or any colored paper you have onhand). Stick the ornaments to the tree with a drop of glue. To stand it up, cuta small rectangle from the green card, then cut slits in the rectangle and thebase of the tree. Slide the pieces together to make the stand.

Emily _loves_ using the hole punch and the glue, so she was more than happy tohelp put this together.

There are a few variations on this idea you can try:

*   Cut identical triangles out of the red and green cards, then punch holes inthe green triangle and paste the entire red triangle behind the greentriangle. The &ldquo;ornaments&rdquo; will show through the holes you made in the tree.This is a lot easier than trying to glue a bunch of tiny ornaments onto atree.
*   Instead of making a tree stand on the bottom, punch a hole at the top of thetree and loop through a piece of ribbon or string to turn the Christmas treeinto an ornament itself.
*   Make two trees then paste them together back-to-back so it looks nice fromboth sides.

It&#x02bc;s not even December yet and I&#x02bc;m already getting into theChristmas spirit!
