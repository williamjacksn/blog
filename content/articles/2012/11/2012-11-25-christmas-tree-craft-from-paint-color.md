I have spent enough time on [Pinterest][a] that I have started to see crafty ideas everywhere. I was recently at
Lowe&#x02bc;s with my three-year-old daughter Emily when we walked past the paint department. I decided to pick up a few
color samples in the hopes that I could do something with them that would entertain Emily for a few minutes.

The Christmas season is upon us, so I asked Emily to pick out a green card and a red card. It wasn&#x02bc;t long before
I had the idea to make this Christmas tree. Cut a triangle out of the green card, the shape of a Christmas tree. Use a
hole punch to make ornaments from the red card (or any colored paper you have on hand). Stick the ornaments to the tree
with a drop of glue. To stand it up, cut a small rectangle from the green card, then cut slits in the rectangle and the
base of the tree. Slide the pieces together to make the stand.

Emily _loves_ using the hole punch and the glue, so she was more than happy to help put this together.

There are a few variations on this idea you can try:

*   Cut identical triangles out of the red and green cards, then punch holes in the green triangle and paste the entire
    red triangle behind the green triangle. The &ldquo;ornaments&rdquo; will show through the holes you made in the
    tree. This is a lot easier than trying to glue a bunch of tiny ornaments onto a tree.
*   Instead of making a tree stand on the bottom, punch a hole at the top of the tree and loop through a piece of ribbon
    or string to turn the Christmas tree into an ornament itself.
*   Make two trees then paste them together back-to-back, so it looks nice from both sides.

It&#x02bc;s not even December yet and I&#x02bc;m already getting into the Christmas spirit!
