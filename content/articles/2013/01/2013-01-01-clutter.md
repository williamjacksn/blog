One of my goals for 2013 is to get rid of clutter. I started by throwing away abunch of hangers that had been hiding in the back of my daughter&#x02bc;s closetfor at least a year. If I haven&#x02bc;t used them for a year, chances are Iwon&#x02bc;t use them at all.

I also threw out some Xbox controllers I had in my office. I don&#x02bc;t evenhave an Xbox. I haven&#x02bc;t had one for a long time. I just have thistendency to hold on to things I believe might be useful someday. I can usuallymake a case for anything being useful eventually.
