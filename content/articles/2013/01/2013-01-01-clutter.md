![Throwing away some hangers][a]

One of my goals for 2013 is to get rid of clutter. I started by throwing away a bunch of hangers that had been hiding in
the back of my daughter&#x02bc;s closet for at least a year. If I haven&#x02bc;t used them for a year, chances are I
won&#x02bc;t use them at all.

I also threw out some Xbox controllers I had in my office. I don&#x02bc;t even have an Xbox. I haven&#x02bc;t had one
for a long time. I just have this tendency to hold on to things I believe might be useful someday. I can usually make a
case for anything being useful eventually.
