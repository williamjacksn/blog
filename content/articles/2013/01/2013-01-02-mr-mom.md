As a working man, it is usually difficult for me to truly appreciate the work mywife does at home. The only insight I am privileged to receive in this areacomes when Rebecca is sick. For the last two days I have been mostly running theshow at home.

Rebecca rang in the new year by lying in bed with a fever for most of yesterdayand today. Today was supposed to be my first day back at work after the holidaybreak, but that got postponed due to Rebecca&#x02bc;s illness.

To make things interesting, my 12-month-old daughter Molly has an incessantlyrunny nose. Whatever illness is inflicting itself upon her, it is making hersleepy a little more than usual and cranky when she is awake.

She also takes offense to having her nose wiped. I have an aversion to snot,especially when it comes in volumes that Molly seems capable of producing. So webutt heads over that throughout the day. My one consolation is that she does sitstill (and seems to enjoy) when I rub lotion on her chapped face.

The weather has been relatively miserable: cold, wet but not rainy, overcast,depressing &mdash; much like what I remember from my winters spent in England. Thatmakes it hard to conjure up anything resembling a desire to leave the house.

I must be a weak one, because on only my second day of being in charge I longedfor a chance to get out of the house. I managed to contain my excitement when Ilearned that we had some books that needed to be returned to the library. Mydaughters were well-behaved even though Emily (3) chose some two-star books totake home. I think for her checking out books from the library is like rollingdice &mdash; she randomly pulls a few books from the shelves and we hope they turnout decently interesting. She had bad luck today.

Emily was excited to hold on to the dime I brought so I could pay a late fee.She proudly presented it to the librarian when we checked out, and nowI&#x02bc;m square with the library.

I felt like we had not enjoyed being out of the house long enough so we made astop at the grocery store and I let Emily choose something from the donutshelves. She picked out a _pan dulce_ only because it had pink frosting. It wasbig but she finished the whole thing by the time we got home.

One thing I really enjoy about being in charge is cooking dinner. Last night Imade fettuccine Alfredo. Rebecca liked it, but the real barometer by which Imeasure the success of my cooking is how much Emily eats. Happily, she cleanedher plate last night and had even more for lunch today.

Tonight I made baked potato soup. This was great because the recipe called foran entire package of bacon.

Rebecca seems to be on the mend, so I imagine I will be back at work tomorrowwith my nose to the grindstone.
