Way back in January, Rebecca sent me a link to [a camping workshop run by theTexas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department](http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/calendar/texas-outdoor-family-workshops) and asked me what I thought about takingEmily camping. My first thought was, &ldquo;Does she know me at all?&rdquo;

I kept the link in my inbox and thought about it for a while and finally, inMay, I decided that no matter how many unpleasant memories of camping as a BoyScout I had, I could make this fun.

Besides, I&#x02bc;m an adult now. I can be responsible and wear sunblock.

So I registered for the workshop and Rebecca told me she was actually reallysurprised that I did. Maybe she does know me after all.

At first it was going to be just me and Emily. But Rebecca thought it would bemore fun if we could find someone else to go with us (Rebecca wouldn&#x02bc;ttouch a tent with a ten-foot tent pole herself). I talked to my friend Josh, whohas a daughter only slightly younger than Emily, and they agreed to go on thisadventure with us.

Because we were camping as part of a workshop, the Parks Department providedmost of the basic equipment: a tent, air mattresses for the adults, sleepingpads for the kids, a lantern, a cooking stove, and pots and pans. We onlyneeded to bring food, clothes, towels, soap, and any other fun things wewanted. And let&#x02bc;s be honest, we never used the soap.

I had no idea what kind of pots and pans we would encounter in our kit so Ibrought along my own cast-iron skillet just to be safe.

We drove out on Friday night (21 June) and stayed until Sunday morning. We gotto choose our own campsite, and we got a nice one right on the shore of [InksLake](http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/state-parks/inks-lake). We spent a long time in the water on Saturday.

We also got to do a little fishing (I caught a 2-inch fish!) and kayaking.Emily had a nice relaxing kayak ride while I rowed her wherever she asked meto.

We saw a fair bit of wildlife, too. We would often see lizards zipping aroundin the grass and on the trees. A deer came through our campsite early Saturdaymorning. Two ducks came to the shore at our site, probably looking for freefood. We also spotted a heron in the water near our site. A pair of cardinalstook some interest in us and even made off with a bit of hot dog bun Emilydropped on the ground. We also saw a wasp that was possibly as big as the fishI caught.

The weather was really nice and we all had a wonderful time! We agreed thatthis was definitely something we want to do again.
