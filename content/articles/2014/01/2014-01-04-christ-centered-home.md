_\[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, December 29,2013.\]_

At the beginning of this month, we hung on the wall a felt advent calendar mywife made. Each morning in December we take a shepherd, or wise man, or angel,or other character from the Christmas story out of a pocket and place it in thescene. As Christmas approaches, the cast of the nativity assembles, culminatingon Christmas morning when a small, felt Christ child is placed in the small,felt manger.

Last week I took an inventory of our home. Including this advent calendar, Icounted no less than 14 nativity scenes. In each depiction, whether it be felt,wood, plastic, ceramic, glass, metal, or crystal, there at the center lies theChrist. What better way to remind us of what our focus should be than to havedepictions of the Savior within our glance almost continually?

Just as each nativity scene is arranged with Christ at the center, we should doall we can to make the Lord Jesus Christ the center of our homes.

Elder Richard G. Scott, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, [said](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/for-peace-at-home),

>  
> When \[Christ\] is the center of your home, there is peace and serenity. Thereis a spirit of assurance that pervades the home, and it is felt by all whodwell there.
> 

In the Book of Mormon, [the prophet Nephi wrote](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26#25),

>  
> And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesyof Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children mayknow to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.

You are probably already familiar with a few fundamental principles that helpmake the Savior the center of your home, but allow me to draw on some of my ownexperiences, both as a child in my parents&#x02bc; home, and as a parent of twosmall children. The three principles I would like to talk about are prayer,scripture study, and family home evening.

The first fundamental principle of a Christ-centered home is prayer. Prophetshave long counseled us to pray daily, both individually and as a family. Iremember praying together with my family when I was a child. No matter whatactivities we were involved in or how busy we were, every day began and endedwith family prayer. I learned to pray by listening to and following the examplesof my parents and older siblings.

From my father and mother I learned to pray for each member of the family byname. When I take the time to think about my wife and each of my childrenindividually, and ask our Heavenly Father to supply their specific needs, I findthat the Holy Ghost can teach me how best to express Christlike love to them. Ina Christ-centered home, where the Holy Ghost can inspire the hearts of eachfamily member, we can meet each other&#x02bc;s needs.

We have often been taught that we can pray for anything, big or small. One day,when I was working on a puzzle with Emily, one of my daughters, we discoveredone piece was missing. We searched for a minute but came up empty-handed. As ifthis sort of thing that happens every day, my daughter said, &ldquo;We better say aprayer so we can find that piece.&rdquo;

Without hesitation, she said a very simple prayer, asking Heavenly Father tohelp us find the missing puzzle piece. After less than a minute of searching,sure enough, we found the piece.

Then Emily said, &ldquo;Okay, now we need to say thank you.&rdquo; Again, withouthesitation, she prayed to Heavenly Father and thanked him for helping us findthe missing puzzle piece. What a humbling example of childlike faith!

We pray to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ. As our prayers become moreheartfelt, by necessity we draw closer to Christ. The first fundamentalprinciple of a Christ-centered home is prayer.

The second fundamental principle of a Christ-centered home is scripture study.If Christ is to be the center of our home, surely the words of Christ should bestudied frequently, both individually and as a family. When I was a child, justas my family ended each day with family prayer, that prayer was preceded byfamily scripture study.

My siblings and I learned to read mostly by reading the scriptures. Before Icould read myself, I started by simply repeating the words after one of myparents.

The language of the scriptures is unlike other things we read, so the younger westart to read them, the more understandable and comfortable they will be to usas we grow older. When our first daughter Emily was about six months old webegan reading the Book of Mormon with her. We usually read about five verses aday. Last night, about three years and ten months after we started, we read thelast few verses of Moroni and finished the book.

One day, about two years after we started this reading, when Emily was two and ahalf years old, she declared that it was her turn to read. She took the Book ofMormon from me, opened it to a page somewhere near the middle, and launched intoone of the most amazing recitations of scripture I have ever heard.

It sounded like she was pulling random scriptural phrases out of her memory andcombining them on the fly. There were also some lines I recognized from Primarysongs scattered throughout her speech. She made liberal use of, &ldquo;and it came topass,&rdquo; of course. If you weren&#x02bc;t listening too carefully, you might thinkshe was reciting an actual verse of scripture.

Even though the words of her performance made no sense when strung together likethat, we recognized that our daughter understand that there was somethingdifferent about the scriptures. I pray that this is only the beginning of ameaningful, personal relationship with the words of Christ.

In my family growing up, we would mostly read through the scriptures linearlytogether. But one summer, we studied the Doctrine and Covenants differently. Myfather put a list of sections on the wall. Each child could choose a section tostudy individually, then make a report to the family about what that section wasabout. When a child reported on a section, it was crossed off the list.

We were pragmatic children, so as you can imagine, the shorter sections wereclaimed quickly. Even though we were always looking for the easiest way tocomplete these assignments, I have specific memories of the Holy Ghosttestifying to my heart that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that through him theLord restored his Gospel in these last days. I will be forever thankful that myparents worked to build a Christ-centered home where I could have theseexperiences and where my testimony could grow.

You may recall the story of the Liahona, that curious brass ball that acted as acompass to Lehi and his family as they travelled through the wilderness. Whenthey had faith that God would use the Liahona to lead them to a land of promise,the Liahona led them. After the travellers arrived on this continent andinherited the land that God promised them, it appears the Liahona&#x02bc;spurpose was fulfilled. But rather than discard it, prophets handed down thissacred object through the generations until it was cared for by a man namedAlma.

As Alma prepared to pass the Liahona on to his son Helaman, [he gave thiscounsel](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.44-45#43):

>  
> For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will pointto you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to giveheed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to thepromised land. \[&hellip;\] For just as surely as this director did bring ourfathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words ofChrist, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into afar better land of promise.
> 

The world is full of sorrow, which only seems to increase with each passing day.If we study the words of Christ and give the scriptures a place in our minds andhearts, we can build our homes into a promised land today.

The second fundamental principle of a Christ-centered home is scripture study.

The third fundamental principle of a Christ-centered home is family homeevening. The idea of a weekly family home evening was formally announced in

1.   Joseph F. Smith, the President of the Church at that time, called forfamilies to

>  
> \[&hellip;\] spend an hour or more together in a devotional way &mdash; in the singing ofhymns, songs, prayer, reading of the Scriptures and other good books,instrumental music, family topics, and specific instructions on the principlesof the Gospel and on the ethical problems of life, as well as the duties andobligations of children to parents, the home, the Church, society and thenation. \[In James R. Clark, comp, _Messages of the First Presidency of TheChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints_, 6 vols. (1965&mdash;75), 5:89\]
> 

This counsel was followed by a promise:

>  
> If the Saints obey this counsel we promise that great blessings will result.Love at home and obedience to parents will increase. Faith will be developedin the hearts of the youth of Israel, and they will gain power to combat theevil influences and temptations which beset them.
> 

In 1970, the Church set aside Monday night as a designated family night, andasked local wards and stakes to not hold activities on that night. I rememberspending Monday nights with my family. We sang songs, played games, acted outscripture stories, and took turns giving lessons about the gospel. Sometimes wedidn&#x02bc;t get along. No family is perfect. But as I recall, we usuallyenjoyed ourselves.

We did not only have family home evening when it was convenient. When my brotherEric and I were in high school, our school choir director announced theorganization of an extra-curricular men&#x02bc;s chorus that would meet torehearse on Monday nights. Eric and I were both singers and wanted toparticipate in this new chorus.

We both knew that on Monday nights our place was at home with our family. Wetalked to the choir director and asked if it would be alright if we were late tothe weekly rehearsal. He said that would be okay. So each Monday night, afterfamily home evening, we went to rehearsal.

We never could convince the director to move rehearsal to another night. Buteven then, I knew that family home evening came first.

So now I have two young girls, and our family home evenings don&#x02bc;t alwaysgo as planned. But in the introduction of the _Family Home Evening ResourceBook_ [it says](https://www.lds.org/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/introduction),

>  
> The most important thing your children will remember is the spirit they feelin your family home evenings and activities. Be sure that the atmosphere isone of love, understanding, and enjoyment. It is more important to have a goodtime with one another than to get through a lesson.
> 

This is encouraging! We definitely have a good time together, and even if wedon&#x02bc;t think our daughters are paying any attention, we have found thatthey get more from the lessons than we think they do.

I have faith that as we make family home evening a priority, our family will bestrengthened and we will draw closer to Christ together. The third fundamentalprinciple of a Christ-centered home is family home evening.

Remember that building a Christ-centered home will not magically remove trialsfrom our lives. [Elder Scott said](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/for-peace-at-home) that

>  
> \[&hellip;\] living an obedient life, firmly rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ,provides the greatest assurance for peace and refuge in our homes. There willstill be plenty of challenges or heartaches, but even in the midst of turmoil,we can enjoy inner peace and profound happiness.
> 

I echo that testimony. We can find joy and love in our homes when we work to putChrist at the center. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
