title: Building a Better Twister Spinner

I got my wife [Twister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)) for Christmas. While we were playing it on Christmasmorning, she remarked that the spinner was not great. It seemed to land on LeftFoot more than we expected.

My first thought was, &ldquo;I could write a quick Python script to get a more randomspinner result!&rdquo; So I grabbed my computer and threw this together in about aminute:

```import random

parts = ['Right Foot', 'Right Hand', 'Left Foot', 'Left Hand']
actions = ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue']
while True:
    input('{} {}'.format(random.choice(parts), random.choice(actions)))
```

This is about the bare minimum I could get away with: choose a random body partand a random color and print the combination. We played this way for a whilebefore my wife had an amazing idea.

&ldquo;It would be really great if the computer could just read the spin result outloud,&rdquo; she said.

I immediately thought of [say](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/say.1.html), because my five-year-old daughter loves toplay with `say` on the command line and make my computer speak. So anotherminute or two later I had modified my script:

```import random
import subprocess

parts = ['Right Foot', 'Right Hand', 'Left Foot', 'Left Hand']
actions = ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue']
while True:
    move = '{} {}'.format(random.choice(parts), random.choice(actions))
    subprocess.call(['say', '-v', 'Samantha', '-r', '150', move])
    input(move)
```

Now we had nice random spins and the computer calling out the moves. But thescript still required someone to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after each move. Thefinal tweak was to make it automatically call out moves after a few seconds:

```import random
import subprocess
import time

parts = ['Right Foot', 'Right Hand', 'Left Foot', 'Left Hand']
actions = ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue']
while True:
    move = '{} {}'.format(random.choice(parts), random.choice(actions))
    print(move)
    subprocess.call(['say', '-v', 'Samantha', '-r', '150', move])
    time.sleep(10)
```

At this point I was pretty happy with the behavior of my quick little script.But I took the opportunity anyway to flesh it out a bit and allow command lineoptions to configure various things. It was a good chance to learn how to usethe [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/argparse.html) module.

The final script is [on GitHub](https://github.com/williamjacksn/twister). It includes command line arguments for:

*   allowing &ldquo;in the air&rdquo; as a valid alternative to a color (our version ofTwister had this move on the spinner);
*   specifying the number of seconds to wait before automatically spinningagain, or requiring someone to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after each spin; and,
*   making the computer speak the spins out loud (only on platforms with the`say` command).

This script was a fun little diversion, and now my wife and I can play Twisterwithout needing a third person to operate the spinner!
