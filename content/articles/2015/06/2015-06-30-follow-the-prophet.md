_\[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, June 28, 2015.\]_

God is our Father and we are his children. His greatest desire is that we, asHis children, grow to become like He is. He has prepared a plan, the Plan ofHappiness, to accomplish [this great work](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39#38), &ldquo;to bring to pass the immortalityand eternal life of man.&rdquo;

Every person in this room, every person in this city, every person who has everbeen born or who will ever be born, made the choice to come to Earth toparticipate in this plan. We &ldquo;[sang together](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/38.7#6), and all the sons \[anddaughters\] of God shouted for joy&rdquo;.

Because of the fall of Adam, when we are born on Earth we are separated fromGod. We also pass through a veil of forgetfulness that blocks our memories ofthe premortal existence.

If we are separated from God, and we cannot remember what we knew before we wereborn, how then can we follow the Plan of Happiness that we were so excitedabout?

God our Father established a pattern to teach His children on Earth the Plan ofHappiness so that we may return to live with Him. He teaches His plan to aprophet and gives that prophet the authority to teach others in His name.

God has followed this pattern, beginning with Adam, the first man, andcontinuing through the ages until we come to His prophet today, Thomas S.Monson.

How do we know this? The prophets did not just teach the people around them.They also recorded important revelations, which were handed down throughgenerations as scripture. [The scriptures record](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.9-10,12#8) the beginning of prophetson earth:

>  
> And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam \[&hellip;\]
> 
> And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesyconcerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God,for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shallhave joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.
> 
> And Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known untotheir sons and their daughters.
> 

We know of many ancient prophets because we have the scriptures before us. Adam,Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, and others in the Old Testament. Peter,James, John, Paul, and others in the New Testament. Lehi, Nephi, Jacob, Alma,Mormon, Moroni, and others in the Book of Mormon. Even our children know thesenames.

All these men were chosen by God, taught the Plan of Salvation, and givenauthority to speak in the name of God.

With the exception of the words of Christ recorded in the New Testament, and ahandful of other sacred moments we know of, the majority of what we consider the&ldquo;word of God&rdquo; was delivered through a prophet.

[We often sing](https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice):

>  
> Come, listen to a prophet&#x02bc;s voice,And hear the word of God
> 

[The Lord has declared](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.34-36#33) through modern-day revelation:

>  
> These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testifythey are of me and not of man;
> 
> For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by mySpirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save itwere by my power you could not have them;
> 
> Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.
> 

When we hear a prophet speak in the name of the Lord, we can testify that wehave heard the voice of the Lord.

Sister Carol F. McConkie, who is currently serving in the Young Women GeneralPresidency, recently taught us the importance of following the prophet. [Shesaid](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/live-according-to-the-words-of-the-prophets):

>  
> When we choose to live according to the words of the prophets, we are on thecovenant path that leads to eternal perfection.
> 

I am familiar with the sad story of a man who chose not to believe therevelation and counsel given through the prophet. At first, in order to getalong with other members of his family, he did appear to follow the prophet. Buthis obedience proved to be only hollow actions. His heart was just not in it,and he often complained about the inconvenient things the prophet asked him todo.

You may be familiar with this story, too. The man&#x02bc;s name was Laman.

Laman saw the prophet of God as merely a man, and did not recognize the divinecalling and authority given by God to that man.

On the other hand, Laman had a brother that faithfully followed the prophet,doing whatever he was commanded to do. Because Laman did not seek to understandthe ways of the Lord, he developed deep feelings of resentment toward hisrighteous brother, Nephi.

What was the legacy Laman left by not following the prophet? He hated hisbrother, Nephi, and wanted to kill him. [He taught his children](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10.17#16) to hate thechildren of Nephi.

>  
> And thus \[the Lamanites\] have taught their children that they should hate \[theNephites\], and that they should murder them, and that they should rob andplunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have aneternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.
> 

One man&#x02bc;s choice brought hundreds of years of hatred, war, destruction,and death to generations of his descendants.

[Sister McConkie continues](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/live-according-to-the-words-of-the-prophets):

>  
> The Lord \[gives us\] the opportunity to choose to believe and obey the words ofthe prophet.
> 
> We heed prophetic word even when it may seem unreasonable, inconvenient, anduncomfortable. According to the world&#x02bc;s standards, following the prophet maybe unpopular, politically incorrect, or socially unacceptable. But followingthe prophet is always right.
> 

If we are to follow the teachings of the living prophet, perhaps I should givesome examples of recent counsel from our prophet today, President Monson. InGeneral Conference just two months ago, he taught us the importance ofworshipping in the temple. [He said](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/blessings-of-the-temple),

>  
> Inside this sacred sanctuary, we find beauty and order. There is rest for oursouls and a respite from the cares of our lives.
> 
> As we attend the temple, there can come to us a dimension of spirituality anda feeling of peace which will transcend any other feeling which could comeinto the human heart. We will grasp the true meaning of the words of theSavior when [He said](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.27#26): &ldquo;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.&hellip; Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
> 
> Such peace can permeate any heart &mdash; hearts that are troubled, hearts that areburdened down with grief, hearts that feel confusion, hearts that plead forhelp.
> 
> My brothers and sisters, in our lives we will have temptations; we will havetrials and challenges. As we go to the temple, as we remember the covenants wemake there, we will be better able to overcome those temptations and to bearour trials. In the temple we can find peace.
> 

President Monson also [recently admonished us](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/ponder-the-path-of-thy-feet) to search the scriptures tolearn specifically about the Savior so that we may follow His example:

>  
> We, with Jesus, can walk the path of obedience. \[&hellip;\] We, like Jesus, can walkthe path of service. \[&hellip;\] Other instructions given to us by the Savior are atour fingertips, found in the holy scriptures. \[&hellip;\] He instructs us to standup bravely for our beliefs, even when we are ridiculed and persecuted. \[&hellip;\]The Savior&#x02bc;s example provides a framework for everything that we do, and Hiswords provide an unfailing guide. His path will take us safely home.
> 

We are blessed to live in a glorious time, when the words of the prophets, bothancient and modern, are readily available. We find them in books, in magazines,on our televisions and computers and phones. Do we recognize and trulyappreciate this great gift? Bishop Gérald Caussé, the First Counselor in thePresiding Bishopric of the Church, [said](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/is-it-still-wonderful-to-you):

>  
> There are so many wonders in this world. However, sometimes when we have themconstantly before our eyes, we take them for granted. We look, but we don&#x02bc;treally see; we hear, but we don&#x02bc;t really listen.
> 

When we look at President Monson, do we really see a prophet of God? When wehear his words, do we really listen? I pray that we will not take the words ofthe prophets for granted.

We can know for ourselves that the prophets speak the word of God. [SisterMcConkie taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/live-according-to-the-words-of-the-prophets):

>  
> As we prayerfully read and study sacred prophetic word with faith in Christ,with real intent, the Holy Ghost will speak truth to our minds and hearts.
> 

In 2008, when Thomas S. Monson became the president of the Church, I rememberreceiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that he was a true prophet of God. Ifelt a feeling of peace in my heart and I knew that I should follow his counsel.

As the years have gone by, I have strived to follow the prophet. My family and Ihave been blessed for heeding his counsel to hold Family Home Evening regularly,study the scriptures together, serve others, live within our means, and prayoften.

With each step of obedience to the words of the Lord as delivered through Hisprophet, the Spirit of God has quietly confirmed truth to my heart and mind.

As we sing in [the hymn](https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice), let us

>  
> heed the words of truth and light  
> That flow from fountains pure.
> 

When the prophet speaks, will we be like Laman, or will we be like Nephi? Thechoice we make today to follow the prophet or not will affect generations tocome.

I testify that God speaks through his prophet, Thomas S. Monson. Jesus Christ isat the head of this Church, and He directs the work of salvation throughPresident Monson and those that serve with him.

I testify that I have heard the voice of the Lord through his prophets.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
