Mayo writes that mostiOS podcast listeners are using Apple&#x02bc;s first-party podcast app:

This is a big deal. Android &mdash; at least on Google&#x02bc;s Nexus devices &mdash; hasnever shipped with a podcast app preinstalled. Google had their own podcast app,Listen, from 2009 to 2012. [They discontinued it](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/giving-you-better-google.html) because there were plentyof other podcast apps available on the Google Play Store.

(Ironically, podcast subscriptions in the Google Listen app were migrated toGoogle Reader. [Google shut down Reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html) less than a year later.)

With the lack of a podcast directory and no first-party app, it is clear thatGoogle doesn&#x02bc;t care about podcasts. But if they are serious about thefuture of advertising, they would do well to pay attention. Advertising inpodcasts is probably the only kind of advertising that I actually pay attentionto.
