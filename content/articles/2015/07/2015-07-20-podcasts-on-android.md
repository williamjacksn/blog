[John Gruber linked][a] to [Benjamin Mayo&#x02bc;s 9to5Mac analysis][b] concerning iOS&#x02bc;s dominance of podcast
listening. Mayo writes that most iOS podcast listeners are using Apple&#x02bc;s first-party podcast app:

> Clearly, having the app preinstalled on the system (as of iOS 8) drives a lot of usage.

This is a big deal. Android &mdash; at least on Google&#x02bc;s Nexus devices &mdash; has never shipped with a podcast
app preinstalled. Google had their own podcast app, Listen, from 2009 to 2012. [They discontinued it][c] because there
were plenty of other podcast apps available on the Google Play Store.

(Ironically, podcast subscriptions in the Google Listen app were migrated to Google Reader. [Google shut down Reader][d]
less than a year later.)

With the lack of a podcast directory and no first-party app, it is clear that Google doesn&#x02bc;t care about podcasts.
But if they are serious about the future of advertising, they would do well to pay attention. Advertising in podcasts is
probably the only kind of advertising that I actually pay attention to.
