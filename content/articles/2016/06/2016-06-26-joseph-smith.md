_\[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, June 26, 2016.\]_

When Christ was on the earth he organized a church so that the gospel could betaught to all nations. He chose certain men as his apostles and gave themauthority to preach the gospel and perform ordinances. Even after his death,resurrection, and ascension to heaven Jesus Christ directed his church throughvisions and revelation to his apostles.

These apostles were prophets. They taught the true doctrine of Christ. Throughrevelation they helped to answer questions and clarify misunderstandings aboutChrist and his gospel. Above all, they testified of Jesus Christ: that he wasthe Son of God; that he died and was resurrected; and that through his atonementall mankind may saved from sin, become perfect, and live with God again.

When these early apostles died, the authority to lead the church was gone.Members of the early Church of Jesus Christ could still rely on the Holy Ghostfor personal revelation, but there was no longer a man called by God to directthe church. Without this revelatory link, many truths of the gospel were lost.Argument and division splintered the church.

The apostle Paul prophesied of this. Referring to the second coming of Christ,[he said](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.3#2), &ldquo;for that day shall not come, except there come a falling awayfirst&rdquo;.

The prophet Nephi also foresaw this. [He said](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.3-4#2),

>  
> For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up,and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I amthe Lord&#x02bc;s; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lord&#x02bc;s; andthus shall every one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord —And they shall contend one with another; and their priests shall contend onewith another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the HolyGhost, which giveth utterance.
> 

Along with this falling away, ancient prophets also foretold of a restoration.The apostle Peter [called it](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/3.21#20) &ldquo;the times of restitution of all things, whichGod hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.&rdquo;Isaiah [called it](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14#13) &ldquo;a marvellous work and a wonder&rdquo;. [It was evenprophesied](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.15#14) that the Lord would raise up a prophet named Joseph.

And so this is the situation we find the world in. There are many churches, allclaiming to be the Lord&#x02bc;s church and fighting with one another. Theauthority to speak in the name of Jesus Christ and to perform the ordinances ofhis gospel is nowhere to be found on the earth.

Through prophecies given anciently, God promised to restore the truths of thegospel. To do this, God needed a prophet on the earth again. [In the words ofElder Neil L. Andersen](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith), &ldquo;Jesus Christ chose a holy man, a righteous man, tolead the Restoration of the fulness of His gospel. He chose Joseph Smith.&rdquo;

[President Wilford Woodruff taught](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-wilford-woodruff/chapter-2), &ldquo;Joseph Smith was kept in the spiritworld for thousands of years to be born in the flesh at the right time, and tobe inspired of God, to be visited by Him, and to be qualified and prepared forthe mission given into his hands.&rdquo;

[Brigham Young likewise testified](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-brigham-young/chapter-47), &ldquo;It was decreed in the counsels ofeternity, long before the foundations of the earth were laid, that he, JosephSmith, should be the man, in the last dispensation of this world, to bring forththe word of God to the people, and receive the fulness of the keys and power ofthe Priesthood of the Son of God.&rdquo;

Joseph experienced first-hand the religious confusion of his day. Reflecting onthat time in his life, [he wrote](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.8#7), &ldquo;so great were the confusion and strifeamong the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young asI was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certainconclusion who was right and who was wrong.&rdquo;

Fortunately, Joseph was raised by righteous parents who taught him theimportance of the scriptures. He studied the Bible on his own. [Joseph recalledthis feeling](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.12#11) after reading James 1:5: &ldquo;Never did any passage of scripturecome with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. Itseemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart.&rdquo;

Joseph had most likely read this scripture before, or heard someone else in hisfamily read it. When you read the scriptures, do you ever get the feeling thatyou are hearing a verse for the very first time, even though you knowyou&#x02bc;ve read it before? Pay attention to that feeling. That is the HolyGhost telling you that that scripture is important for you at that moment. Itmay be an answer to a question that is troubling you, or, like it was forJoseph, instructions for what to do to obtain an answer.

[Joseph learned](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith) that &ldquo;spiritual questions deserve spiritual answers fromGod.&rdquo;

And so when he was 14 years old, Joseph Smith went to a quiet spot in the forestnear his home to pray for direction. What were you doing when you were 14 yearsold? I&#x02bc;ll tell you what I was doing. I was writing in my journal abouthow much I love _Star Wars_.

What happened in answer to Joseph Smith&#x02bc;s prayer was the beginning of thedispensation of the fulness of times. In his own words:

>  
> I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun,which descended gradually until it fell upon me. \[&hellip;\] When the light restedupon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by nameand said, pointing to the other — This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!
> 

God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ, visited Joseph Smith. Christ toldJoseph that none of the churches on the earth at that time taught the fulness ofthe gospel. None of them had the authority to act in the name of Jesus Christ.Joseph was promised that the truths of the gospel and the authority to organizeChrist&#x02bc;s true church would be given to him.

Joseph Smith&#x02bc;s work was just beginning. When he was 17 years old, Josephwas visited by an angel named Moroni. Joseph learned about an ancient recordthat he would later translate by the power of God, The Book of Mormon.

What were you doing when you were 17 years old? I&#x02bc;ll tell you what I wasdoing. I was writing in my journal about being excited to check my email.

As part of his message, the angel [Moroni told Joseph](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.33#32) &ldquo;that \[his\] nameshould be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, orthat it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.&rdquo; In what wayare you fulfilling this prophecy? Do you speak good or evil of the prophetJoseph Smith? [Neil L. Andersen said](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith), &ldquo;Gain a personal witness of theProphet Joseph Smith. Let your voice help fulfill Moroni&#x02bc;s propheticwords to speak good of the Prophet.&rdquo;

When he was 21 years old, Joseph received the record that Moroni had told himabout. After some moving around to escape constant persecution, he was 23 yearsold when he took about two months to translate a book that is over 500 pageslong. What were you doing when you were 23 years old? I was in college and Idon&#x02bc;t think I could even read 500 pages in two months.

While translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph learned much about the gospel ofJesus Christ. He learned about priesthood authority. He was visited by John theBaptist, and later by the ancient apostles Peter, James and John. These angelicvisitors conferred on Joseph Smith the priesthood, or the authority to act inthe name of Jesus Christ.

When Joseph was 24 years old, now holding the proper authority, he formallyorganized the Church of Christ. After hundreds of years, the church that JesusChrist himself had organized was now back on earth. And Joseph Smith was theprophet that Christ had chosen to do this work.

In the years that followed, revelation continued to flow to the church throughthe prophet Joseph. He called other men as apostles. He organized missionarywork. He directed the construction of temples and the Lord revealed to him thetemple ordinances such as baptism for the dead and the endowment, and eternalmarriage. Many of the revelations he received were recorded in what is now thebook of Doctrine and Covenants.

[The Lord Jesus Christ said](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35.17-18#16):

>  
> \[&hellip;\] I have sent forth the fulness of my gospel by the hand of my servantJoseph; and in weakness have I blessed him; And I have given unto him the keysof the mystery of those things which have been sealed, even things which werefrom the foundation of the world, and the things which shall come from thistime until the time of my coming \[&hellip;\]
> 

[Joseph&#x02bc;s testimony](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.22-24#21) of Jesus Christ is this:

>  
> And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is thetestimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! For we saw him,even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that heis the Only Begotten of the Father — That by him, and through him, and of him,the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sonsand daughters unto God.

The truthfulness of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rests on thetruthfulness of the First Vision and the other revelations the Lord gave to theProphet Joseph.

I have a testimony that Joseph Smith was chosen by Jesus Christ to restore thegospel and organize his church. I know that the authority to lead the church andspeak in the name of Jesus Christ has been conferred through latter-day prophetsin an unbroken line and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints isdirected by Jesus Christ through a prophet today.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
