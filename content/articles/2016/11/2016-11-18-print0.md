title: You, too, can -print0

Do you use the command line a lot? Do you search for files with `find(1)`? Do you send lists of files to `xargs(1)`? Do
the files sometimes have names with spaces, apostrophes, and other special characters in them? Do you think it is great
that `find -print0` takes care of that when you produce filenames, and `xargs -0` takes care of that when you consume
them?

Do you write your own command line tools?

Do your command line tools generate lists of files? Can I send the output of your tools to `xargs`, even if the files
have names with special characters in them?

You, too, can separate filenames in the output of your command line tools with a null character instead of a newline.

This is how I usually do it in Python:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-0', '--print0', action='store_true')
args = parser.parse_args()

for filename in generate_filenames_somehow():
    if args.print0:
        print(filename, end='\x00')
    else:
        print(filename)
```
