_\[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, May 14, 2017.\]_

We are all here on Earth to follow the plan of salvation and return to live withour Heavenly Father. We all agreed to come to Earth and knew that when we did,we would forget about our heavenly home.

God sent prophets to teach us the plan of salvation. We read their words in thescriptures, and are privileged to live in a time when there are prophets livingon the Earth with us and givings us counsel appropriate for our time.

In addition to this, God has promised us the help of a member of the Godhead,the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can give us personal counsel appropriate for thevery moment and situation we may find ourself in.

Today I would like to speak about how to seek out, recognize, and act upon theinspiration of the Holy Ghost.

Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin [said](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift),

>  
> When we are confirmed, we are given the _right_ to the companionship of theHoly Ghost, but it is a right that we must continue to earn through obedienceand worthiness. We cannot take this gift for granted.
> 

We can prepare ourselves to receive the inspiration of the Holy Ghost throughobedience. The apostle Peter taught that God gives the Holy Ghost to those thatobey him. [Paul wrote](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.14#14) that

>  
> the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they arefoolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spirituallydiscerned.
> 

Elder Wirthlin [also said](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift),

>  
> I fear that some members of the Lord&#x02bc;s Church &ldquo;live far beneathour privileges&rdquo; with regard to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Some aredistracted by the things of the world that block out the influence of the HolyGhost, preventing them from recognizing spiritual promptings. This is a noisyand busy world that we live in. Remember that being busy is not necessarilybeing spiritual. If we are not careful, the things of this world can crowd outthe things of the Spirit.
> 

If we wish to seek out the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we may need to makechanges to our environment to make it more conducive to the presence of theSpirit. Elder Wirthlin [asks](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift),

>  
> Do we allow influences into our homes that drive the Spirit from our homes?The type of entertainment that we permit into our homes will certainly have animpact on the power of the Holy Ghost. Much of the entertainment of the worldis offensive to the Holy Ghost. Surely we should not watch movies ortelevision shows that are filled with violence, vulgar language, andimmorality.
> 

Elder Wirthlin also [makes the following suggestions](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift):

>  
> Our homes need to be more Christ-centered. We should spend more time at thetemple and less time in the pursuit of pleasure. We should lower the noiselevel in our homes so that the noise of the world will not overpower thestill, small voice of the Holy Ghost. One of our greatest goals as parentsshould be to enjoy the power and influence of the Holy Ghost in our homes. Weshould pray and study the scriptures. We could sing the hymns of theRestoration to invite the Holy Ghost into our home. Regular family homeevening will also help.
> 

After we have prepared ourselves and prepared our environment to invite theinspiration of the Holy Ghost, the best thing we can do to seek that inspirationis to pray and ask for it.

The Lord [has said](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14#14),

>  
> the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith.
> 

President Boyd K. Packer [taught](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/prayer-and-promptings),

>  
> Learn to pray. Pray often. Pray in your mind, in your heart. Pray on yourknees. Prayer is your personal key to heaven. The lock is on your side of theveil.
> 

The Savior [said](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.63#63),

>  
> Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and yeshall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened untoyou.
> 

Sincere prayer is how we knock, ask, seek, and draw near unto the Lord.

<h3 id="recognize">Recognize</h3>

As we seek out the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, how do we recognize it when itcomes? I have heard many people, in one way or another express the followingquestion: If I have a thought to serve someone, how do I know if that thought isinspired by the Holy Ghost, or if I just came up with it myself?

To that question I offer as answer [the words of Moroni](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.13#13) in the Book ofMormon:

>  
> But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually;wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to loveGod, and to serve him, is inspired of God.
> 

Notice that Moroni did not say, &ldquo;a thing which inviteth to do good _might_be inspired of God.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;every thing which inviteth \[&hellip;\] todo good \[&hellip;\] _is_ inspired of God.&rdquo;

You can recognize the inspiration of the Holy Ghost by asking yourself whetherthe thought you just had is an invitation to do good. Moroni also said,&ldquo;all things which are good cometh of God.&rdquo; Not some things,&ldquo;all things.&rdquo;

<h3 id="act">Act</h3>

Once we have recognized the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, it becomes ourprivilege and duty to act upon the inspiration we receive.

One of the most dramatic and well-known events involving the inspiration of theHoly Ghost is recorded in the New Testament, in [Acts, chapter 2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2). Whilepreaching on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Ghost came upon the apostles, and asthey preached, each person heard them speak in their own native language.

After Peter boldly testified of the divinity of Jesus Christ, [we read](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37#37) thatmany in the multitude &ldquo;were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peterand to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo;

Upon recognizing the influence of the Holy Ghost, these people immediatelywanted to know what to do next. [Peter&#x02bc;s answer](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2.38#38) was, &ldquo;Repent,and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; We learnfrom the scriptures that about three thousand people were baptized that sameday, acting on the inspiration that they received.

When we recognize the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we should not wait to acton it. [In the words of a hymn](https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/dearest-children-god-is-near-you),

>  
> Children, God delights to teach you  
> By his Holy Spirit&#x02bc;s voice.  
> Quickly heed its holy promptings.  
> Day by day you&#x02bc;ll then rejoice.
> 

We may not always understand the purpose of a prompting, or how a small act ofkindness can make a difference to anyone, but when we quickly act oninspiration, we show to the Lord that we will do what He wants us to do. If wedo not act, it may make it harder to recognize inspiration in the future.

>  
> [For behold](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30#30), thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of menline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; andblessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto mycounsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will givemore; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be takenaway even that which they have.

Conclusion

If you feel like it has been a long time since you last recognized theinspiration of the Holy Ghost, do not be discouraged. God is our Father andloves each of us perfectly.

>  
> [He sent](https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/i-know-my-father-lives) \[us\] here to earth, by faith to live his plan.  
> The Spirit whispers this to \[us\] and tells \[us\] that \[we\] can.
> 

I know that as we keep the commandments we make ourselves worthy to receive theHoly Ghost. I know that as we bulid sacred and holy environments around us, weinvite the Holy Ghost to be close. I know that if we pray sincerely to receivinspiration, that inspiration will come.

We are God&#x02bc;s angels on Earth. Through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,God instructs us and sends us forth to serve his children, our brothers andsisters.

I know the Holy Ghost will teach us. He will show us what we need to do so thatall of us, as the family of God, can return to live with our Father in Heaven.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
