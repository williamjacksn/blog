So I've had this blog for a while. I have gone
through several backends in its long lifetime. The oldest
articles actually predate the blog &mdash; I ran a newletter
of sorts out of my very fidst smail address, inflicting my
awkward writing on family and friends.

I've used Movable Type. I've used WordPress.
I've used LiveJournal and Xanga and Tumblr and &hellip;
not MySpace. I don't think I ever had a MySpace
page.
