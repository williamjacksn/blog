So I&#x02bc;ve had this blog for a while. I have gone
through several backends in its long lifetime. The oldest
articles actually predate the blog &mdash; I ran a newletter
of sorts out of my very first email address, inflicting my
awkward writing on family and friends.

I&#x02bc;ve used Movable Type. I&#x02bc;ve used WordPress.
I&#x02bc;ve used Blogger and LiveJournal and Xanga and Tumblr and &hellip;
not MySpace. I don&#x02bc;t think I ever had a MySpace page.
