<blockquote>
  <p>I sit by the dimming firelight<br />
and watch the flames dance<br />
over the white-hot ashes,<br />
and hear the soft crack<br />
of the burning wood.<br />
I think:<br />
Who sat here many years before?<br />
Was this the Great Circle where the Natives would dance?<br />
I see the never-ending movement of the arms and feet,<br />
Dancers adorned with rainbows,<br />
hopping from one foot to the other.<br />
I hear the relentless beating of the drum,<br />
the heart of the Dance,<br />
and the chants and cries of all who watch.<br />
I feel the ground tremble from the Dancers,<br />
and the drums,<br />
and people cheering them on,<br />
and as the Dance continues<br />
its sole purpose identifies itself<br />
as the Rain begins to drop from the heavens to the waiting Earth.<br />
The Dancers º outstretched arms meet the Rain.
They stop,<br />
their purpose fulfilled.<br />
All cheer and run to shelter.<br />
I sit by the dimming firelight,<br />
as the sparks take flight,<br />
as if to run from the heaven-sent blessing of Rain,<br />
and I see that I am here and they are there,<br />
yet they live on<br />
in the Rain.</p>
