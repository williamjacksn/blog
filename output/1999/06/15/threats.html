<p>Although usually an unhappy topic, itʼs amazing what threats can and
canʼt do. Lucky for you, I have several examples. Isnʼt this so
inspiring?</p>

<p>Case 1: Last week I had the opportunity to assist in the instruction of young
boys in the art of archery. These boys, whose ages ranged anywhere from six to
eleven, were covertly competing against each other to see who could launch his
projectile the farthest. Of course, the other staff members and I had to
retrieve the arrows, and, being our lazy selves, we didnʼt want to walk
more than absolutely necessary. Therefore, this situation called for an
appropriate threat.</p>

<p>“Do it again, kid, and weʼll duct tape you to the target and paint
concentric circles on your stomach.”</p>

<p>Now, we knew that the head instructor, Mr. Tom, wouldnʼt let us do this,
but the kids didnʼt have to know. This tactic worked quite well until one
of the older boys was smart enough to realize that there was nothing behind our
threat. We walked farther the rest of the week. The battle was lost. The war
still rages.</p>

<p>Case 2: This is a brief one. Itʼs painful for me to dwell on threats that
donʼt accomplish anything. It brings a tear to my eye …</p>

<p>For some reason unknown to me my sister can get away with almost anything. That
brings a tear to my eye as well. Accordingly, threats neither work against her
nor bother her. Sheʼll run to my mother, put on her “sweet
child” charade, and it all comes out right in the end … for her.
Iʼm the one at fault. I threatened her. My mother locks me in my room.
Itʼs as simple as that.</p>

<p>Case 3: This case encompasses the notorious line, “Itʼs not a
threat, itʼs a promise.” As everyone knows, this only causes the
one being threatened to know what little you can do to follow through on you
threat. Itʼs like reverse psychology, only in reverse. So that would make
it reverse reverse psychology, or maybe forward psychology. But that makes it
regular old psychology. Maybe itʼs not reverse, but to the left. That
sounds right. To-the-left psychology. An interesting field of study.</p>

<p>“Whatʼs your major?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Iʼm going to double-major in upside-down chaos theory and
to-the-left psychology. How about you?”</p>

<p>“I was going to go into somersault calculus, but now Iʼm not
sure.”</p>

<p>Iʼm so glad thereʼs no such thing as to-the-left psychology. You
should be, too. Donʼt forget to go out and make an empty threat at least
once a day this week! Itʼs good for you.</p>
