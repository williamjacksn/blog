<p>Everybody has them. Everybody does them. Everybody hates them. If you
donʼt, we need to speak privately. Yes, I am speaking of chores, those
wonderful things parents use to occupy you. There are daily chores, as (almost)
everyone knows, and there are “special” chores. First come the daily
chores.</p>

<p>As you may already know, I am a member of a family of eleven children. One is
out of the house at this writing, but that doesnʼt change much at home.
Even if all the “normal” chores are assigned, everyone must have
something to do. Therefore, this week, I am assigned the following chore:
“Wash by hand all the dishes that are too large to fit in the
dishwasher.” You may immediately think, as I did, “What kind of
chore is that? Who thought <em>that</em> up?” I asked my mother those very
questions. Of course, I didnʼt ask her in that particular tone. I want to
live to see my next birthday, you see. I asked politely, “Was this chore
your idea? Is it really necessary?”</p>

<p>Her immediate reply was, “If you are going to complain about your job,
then Iʼm going to take away points!”</p>

<p>A brief explanation of “points”. We get “points” when we
do our chores and other extra things around the house. At the end of the week,
we can “buy” items with our points. Of course, all the items are
outrageously priced, so you have to work your fingers off to buy a
“fun-sized” candy bar. Now that I mentioned it,
one-bite-and-itʼs-gone is not my idea of “fun-sized”. Back to
the subject, I really donʼt care for points, so I just do my job whenever
I feel like it, or when Mother makes me. Iʼve gotten to where I am
indifferent to washing dishes now. Is that good or bad?</p>

<p>Now on to “special” chores. Evidently, when you are offered a
“special” chore, it is the equivalent of your guardian saying,
“Youʼre going to do this whether you like it or not, even though
itʼs not part of your regular chore schedule (pronounced
‘shed-yule’).” As you can see, chore-givers try to use
psychology to trick you into wanting to do chores (for a shallow look at
psychology, please see <a href="/1999/06/15/threats">Turtleʼs Thoughts™ on Threats</a>).</p>
