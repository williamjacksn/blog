<p>This edition of Turtleʼs Thoughts™ is quite the ironic situation. I am presently sitting at my grandmotherʼs computer, busily typing away. I didnʼt expect to be able to send the column today, but Iʼm still sure it wonʼt come next week. Even when Iʼm on vacation, Iʼm working on this stuff! Am I responsible or what?</p>

<p>What.</p>

<p>Vacations can be used for different reasons: going to see people, running from people, stress reduction, etc. If your family is like mine, you will find this very familiar, maybe even scary. I am dropping to the level of using a military time frame. A family vacation is a sort of well planned operation, and I thought it would be interesting.</p>

<p>Day 1; 0600. All rise, for we have to get an early start. We are supposed to leave at 0700. We left at 0830. Go figure …</p>

<p>0835. After leaving the house, we panic over something we think weʼve forgotten, realize we havenʼt forgotten it, calm down, remember something else that we think weʼve forgotten, panic …</p>

<p>0900. “Are we out of Texas yet?” My brother, after living in the state for eleven years, still cannot comprehend the immensity of this barren land.</p>

<p>0930. “I have to go to the bathroom.” A classic trip-starter. Donʼt ask me why.</p>

<p>1000. “Iʼm bored.” “Donʼt worry, this vacation will be fun <em>and</em> educational.”</p>

<p>1130. “Iʼm hungry; whenʼs lunch?” This was a popular complaint throughout the entire trip, although everyone knew if you wanted to eat out of schedule, you had to bring your own food. Luckily, my brother had a hidden cache. Lucky for him, at least.</p>

<p>Is anyone else sick of the military time thing? I apologize. On to bigger and better things.</p>

<p>Itʼs great to spend some time with your grandparents, but not to spend <em>all</em> your vacation time with them. That would be boring, to say the least.</p>

<p>I am not saying that my grandparents are boring. My grandparents are some of the most interesting people I know. If you call my grandfather a farmer heʼll knock you flat. He has the will (and the hands) to do it. Heʼs a “dairyman”.</p>

<p>I donʼt mean to sound gross or anything, but why is it that your cousins are always so good-looking? Beats me.</p>

<p>This is Turtle, signing off.</p>
