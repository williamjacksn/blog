<p>Loyal Readers,</p>

<p>We regret to inform you that, due to his busy schedule, the author of “Turtleʼs Thoughts” has not had the free time to compile an article for this week. Furthermore, the article will no longer be sent out Tuesday morning, but at a later time, which is to be decided in the near future. Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

<p>The Executive Board of Turtleʼs Thoughts</p>
