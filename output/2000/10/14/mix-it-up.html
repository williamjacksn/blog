<blockquote>
  <p>If I were in charge of the world,<br />
Iʼd change a thing or two.
Iʼd leave all the forces of physics alone,
And the sky would always remain blue.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what if you looked out your window,<br />
And much to your surprise,<br />
Raining it was, but quite the wrong way,<br />
From the ground right on up to the skies!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iʼm not complaining, donʼt get me wrong.
I like it all just how it be.<br />
But oh, how much fun to mix-it-up,<br />
And give it a touch of “me”.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every now and then,<br />
The sun should turn green, I think.<br />
And cast a relaxing chartreuse glow<br />
On the grassy fields (which are pink).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine if you will<br />
The violet bark of a tree.<br />
And just how much more could be done<br />
If you had not two arms, but three!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iʼm not complaining, I must admit.
If none of this happens, thatʼs fine.
But oh, how much fun to mix-it-up,<br />
And give it a dash of “mine”.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I could give you a gift,<br />
The world would be yours to command.<br />
From birds to bikes to a summerʼs day,
All things would look just as you planned.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sun, the moon, the stars at night,<br />
The pencil I hold in my hand,<br />
Would be rearranged at the slightest thought,<br />
Just as the waves shape the sand.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You donʼt have change a single grain,
Or all of those other things, too.<br />
But oh, how much fun to mix-it-up,<br />
Until the world speaks of “you”.</p>
</blockquote>
