<p>Itʼs morning. Iʼm still in the air. I looked out the window and was reminded of Lehiʼs journey across the many waters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His first time to cross the many waters;<br />
His first time to fly across the sea;<br />
A journey to a distant land,<br />
He put himself into Godʼs hand
So he could be all God wants him to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a thick layer of clouds under us. It looks like we are flying over a polar ice cap.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though he feels the smallest of all Godʼs creation
In his mind and in his heart he knows the truth.<br />
A call from the Divine had come;<br />
He knows that he must leave his home<br />
And spread Godʼs word abroad while in his youth.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sun will rise, the sun will set; a day will pass.<br />
Yet if just one soul knows more than what he did the last<br />
The journey was worthwhile.<br />
The Son has risʼn, the Son has come; Heʼll come again.
In His eyes He wants each soul to be His friend.<br />
Letʼs go the extra mile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sunrise. Inspiration. Call it what you will, its beauty will always exceed my expectations.</p>
