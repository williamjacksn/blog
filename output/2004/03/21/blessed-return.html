<p>Today marks the end of my Spring Break holiday. What a welcome break it has been. I take back that part about yard work being fun. Working in someone elseʼs yard is fun. Working in oneʼs own yard may not necessarily be so. Still, the satisfaction of a job well done is always a genuine motivation ex post facto.</p>

<p>In the long run, I suppose I accomplished plenty of nothing and a bit of something over the workless week. I went to Dallas twice (Thursday and Saturday) to visit <a href="http://www.lds.org/church/temples/dallas-texas">the temple</a>, first with my parents and then with my brother and sister. That is where the real peace and quiet was to be found.</p>

<p>I also endured a fun-filled birthday celebration as I turned 22 on Wednesday. Thanks to Amber for the (hopefully) truth-defying “My GPA Sucks” shirt. Thanks to Mary for the mug of green gingham (and/or check).</p>
