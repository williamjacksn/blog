<p>Iʼm up late again. Or shall I say early? I got to talking to a friend about some Java programming for a class, and he gave me some ideas about how to get the program done. So I up and coded for another hour or two.</p>

<p>Then another friend came online and Iʼve been chatting away ever since. Thatʼs my weakness: friends. Contact. Communication. Iʼll stay up all night if I have someone to talk to. Thatʼs what I did the night before my birthday last week.</p>

<p>I may be more tired than sled dogs the next morning, but I donʼt ever regret it. Time spent with friends is never wasted.</p>

<p>Time spent programming, however, might be. Wasted, that is.</p>
