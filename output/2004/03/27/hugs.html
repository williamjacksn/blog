<p>A hug is a rather interesting form of communication. It reflects a different attitude towards a person than a kiss. It canʼt be compared to a handshake. All these types of contact speak different ideas.</p>

<p>You can say just about anything with a hug. “I love you” is probably the most prolific genre of hug given. Then thereʼs “I missed you,” “I was so worried,” and a personal favorite of mine, “What up my brotha (sic)!”</p>

<p>You could even feign friendship with a hug to a “long time-no see (but not long enough)” type acquaintance. Itʼs disgustingly low and highly disgusting, but nevertheless can be done.</p>

<p>Depending on how you look at them, hugs can be the only way to express true feelings, or the only way to avoid expressing true feelings. A hug <em>is</em> a rather interesting form of communication.</p>

<p>So which meant hug, the “x” or the “o”?</p>
