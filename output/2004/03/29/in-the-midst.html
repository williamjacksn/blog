<p>Today I read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you. (3 Nephi 20:22, The Book of Mormon)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you guess the speaker? Can you imagine what it would be like that day? Can you wait? The one thing that this verse made clear to me – and I thought I already knew it (you know how that is) – was that Jesus Christ <em>is</em> the powers of heaven! I know, it sounds obvious now, but when you read it for the first time and the Holy Ghost says, “Hey, bub, are you paying attention here?” itʼs a special moment. Iʼm glad I could share it with someone.</p>
