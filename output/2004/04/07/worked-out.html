<p>And I did go work out, and boy are my legs tired. That must have been the first real workout in a real workout room with real workout equipment in a few years.</p>

<p>It reminds me of my senior year in high school, when I … <em>fade into white … cue psychedelic flashback music …</em></p>

<p>When my senior year of high school rolled around, I still lacked a full year of athletic credit to graduate. I was forced (yes, forced) to take a P.E. class all year. I signed up for a class called “Applications of Personal Fitness”. That sounded like a normal “team sports” kinda class to me, but much to my surprise …</p>

<p><strong><em>Powerlifting!</em></strong> and I couldnʼt have been more depressed. I thought my life was over. I was easily the weakest man (boy?) in there, and if any one of those brutes had it in for me I wouldnʼt have lasted two sets of four reps.</p>

<p>To spoil a long story, it turned out to be the most rewarding and fun year of my life to that point. My self esteem improved more than my bench press, and I <em>was</em> the most improved lifter in the class, even though I was still lifting the least out of everyone.</p>

<p>There is a moral to this story. Points to she who guesses it.</p>
