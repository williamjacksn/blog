<p>Time waits for no man, not even me, as I sit at my computer, organizing, reorganizing, listening to music, typing here and there, sipping FlavorAid (which could use a little flavor aid, if you know what I mean).</p>

<p>Which I have been doing for that last five hours straight.</p>

<p>No, thatʼs not true. I got up to do my laundry, then to put my laundry in the dryer, then to cook dinner, then to eat dinner.</p>

<p>Well, I did accomplish the eating phase while at the computer. Thereʼs one word for me: junkie.</p>

<p>And by the way, if you were expecting a poem-a-day or something, just keep on expecting and the likelihood of such an event might increase.</p>
