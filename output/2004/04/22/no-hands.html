<p>This is the first remote post I have ever remotely posted. Iʼm so excited! The story goes like this:</p>

<p>I only have a dialup internet connection, so the website is only online when I am online. Iʼve had to share with Aaron for the last three months (which is cool, because the phone bill gets split between us) so whenever I left the apartment, I went offline. Bummer for the site.</p>

<p>Well, yesterday Aaron got broadband installed, so heʼs always online but never on the phone line. Iʼm not hooked into the “swift river of information” yet, but at least now I can leave my computer on the phone when I leave. It may only be a “bubbling brook” or “dripping faucet”, but it is so all the time!</p>

<p>Which allows me to bring to you (all two of you who read this) a real-time remote post. Iʼm not even at my computer right now. Imagine that.</p>

<p>I also got a webcam yesterday and have been showing it off to all my friends online. Some of my family that frequent the Internet havenʼt seen it yet, and I canʼt wait to show them. Technology rocks!</p>

<p>If there are more than two of you, post a comment and introduce yourself.</p>
