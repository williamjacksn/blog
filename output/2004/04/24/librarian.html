<blockquote>
  <p>Thick-rimmed glasses:<br />
The ones that came back in style last year.<br />
You canʼt get them out of your mind, you know the kind.
They seem to whisper, “Thereʼs more than meets the eye over here.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Youʼve never seen her let her hair down,
And you never will, you fear.<br />
But “The hair does not the woman make,” for heavenʼs sake.
Thereʼs more than meets the eye over here.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>She reads <em>Snow White</em>,<br />
And one day her Prince Charming will appear.<br />
Without so much as a second look, sheʼll put down her book.
Thereʼs more than meets the eye over here.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oblivious men (but I repeat myself),<br />
Who havenʼt got ears to hear
The honey-sweet song in each “Hello”, will never know<br />
Thereʼs more than meets the eye over here.</p>
