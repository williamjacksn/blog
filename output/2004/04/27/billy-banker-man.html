<blockquote>
  <p>Billy the Banker bought his gun<br />
(While under the influence of the broiling sun)<br />
To get back at that Cheater-man<br />
Known only affectionately as “Dan”.</p>

  <p>ʼTwas a Colt, and a mighty fine pistol, friend,
That Billy chose; Danʼs life would end<br />
Before sunset in two daysʼ time.
(Itʼs your job to complete this rhyme.)</p>

  <p>So the sun came up, and the sun went down,<br />
And the stars shined bright, and the moon went ʼround.
When the evening came on the second day<br />
Bill called to Dan to come out and play.</p>

  <p>Billy faced east and Dan faced west<br />
And prepared for a classic quick-draw contest.<br />
The sheriff was there to referee<br />
(his money on Dan, I gaurantee).</p>

  <p>A drummer-boy standing in a shady place<br />
Began to beat as they took each pace.<br />
One, and they took one step apart.<br />
Two clearly heard a beating heart.</p>

  <p>Three women turned, trying not to faint.<br />
Four children stared without complaint.<br />
Five birds sat silent in the trees.<br />
Six feathers rustled in the evening breeze.</p>

  <p>Seven crickets chirped unknowingly.<br />
Eight leaves fell from the old shade tree.<br />
Nine men felt time had slowed to a crawl.<br />
Ten, this would end once and for all.</p>

  <p>Dan spun ʼround and Billy did, too,
And then came the part everyone thought they knew:<br />
But Billy was blinded by the setting sun,<br />
And Dan by the glare off of Billyʼs gun.</p>

  <p>No shots were fired, but both men fell.<br />
Down went the sun and up came a yell.<br />
Billy and Dan were helped to their feet.<br />
They dusted themselves and walked off the street.</p>

  <p>So ends the Ballad of the Banker-man<br />
And his new business partner, Cheater-Dan.<br />
Billy and Dan are now good friends,<br />
And this is how the story ends.</p>
