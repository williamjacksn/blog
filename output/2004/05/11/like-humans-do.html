<p>I stayed up until 12:45 last night/this morning watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0167261/"><em>The Two Towers</em></a>. Thatʼs a great movie. But itʼs long. To quote myself, it was “as long as my arm times two,” and thatʼs long. I have long arms. Thatʼs why itʼs long.</p>

<p>But anyway, I was thinking, why would anyone want to sit for such a long time watching a movie like that? Iʼve noticed that most movies that have been released recently are longer than movies released five years ago. I think we as a human family have a pulsating attention span. We all have attention deficit disorder one decade, and patience like nobodyʼs business the next. Why canʼt we settle down? Perhaps itʼs the tides.</p>

<p>Or El Niño. That would do it. I read <a href="/2004/05/11/nino.pdf">a great paper about El Niño</a> today, that explained the very reason we have such a problem with it (El Niño): we as a society refuse to satiate Peruvian gods.</p>

<p>I knew it all along.</p>
