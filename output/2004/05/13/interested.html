<p>Okay, I just got off the phone. I just had the most surreally random conversation this year. It went:</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Hello?<br />
<strong>Some Guy:</strong> Hello, may I speak to William please? <em>(I didnʼt recognize the voice.)</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> This is he.<br />
<strong>Some Guy:</strong> Hello, William. This is Josh, from <em>_I forgot the company name he said_</em>. I understand youʼre interested in computers.
<strong>Me:</strong> Yes. <em>(At this point Iʼm thinking, “Heʼs going to offer me a job for the summer. My prayers have been answered!”)</em>
<strong>Josh:</strong> Would you be interested in a Pentium III processor for 400 dollars?<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> No I wouldnʼt. <em>(I was really disappointed about not getting the job, so I decided to disappoint him.)</em>
<strong>Josh:</strong> You wouldnʼt? Do you know anyone who would?
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>(Impatient yet polite)</em> No, Iʼm afraid I donʼt.
<strong>Josh:</strong> <em>(Disappointed)</em> You donʼt.
<strong>Me:</strong> Nope.  But thanks for the offer.<br />
<strong>Josh:</strong> Okay, goodbye.</p>

<p>This just happened to me. This is not a joke. I still think itʼs unbelievable.</p>
