<p><strong>Pasta:</strong> Beat two eggs in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Mix in flour (probably 2+ cups) until dough is not sticky. Flatten with rolling pin and cut into thin strips. Drop into boiling water (with salt if desired) for 2-3 minutes. Remove and drain.</p>

<p><strong>Sauce:</strong> Heat a small amount of olive oil (extra virgin!) in a frying pan. Add thin slices of fresh garlic and fresh diced onion. When garlic and onion pieces are brown, add fresh (or canned) diced tomatoes. Add salt, pepper, and any spices you want. Basil is good.</p>

<p>Mix pasta and sauce together. Serve hot. Eat with chopsticks.</p>
