  <p>Real knowledge is to know the extent of one始s ignorance. (Confucius)</p>

<p>I am ignorant concerning how much sleep I need. I tried to tell Body that four hours a night would be sufficient. I tried convinving Body that every once in a while I could just skip the sleep thing, and there would be no side effects. I even think I had Body convinced of these ideas at one point.</p>

<p>But not now. No, Body knows how much sleep Body needs. And Body takes it, he does. He takes the precious sleep and ignores the stupid fat alarm clock in the morning! Body doesn始t care if we needs to be at work at 7:45 AM. Body doesn始t care if we volunteers to work 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM. Body just endures the pain we puts him through, and waits to plot his revenge. Yessss, revenge, so juicy sweet! He waits for just the right time, when we isn始t suspecting anything, and he tricks us! Body makes us sleep when we should be getting ready for work.</p>

<p>Tricksy Body.</p>
