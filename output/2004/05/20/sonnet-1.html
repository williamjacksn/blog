<blockquote>
  <p>The library is quiet in the morn,<br />
As quiet as the death all men must take.<br />
The lack of students makes me feel forlorn,<br />
Resembling silent field and frozen lake.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before too long the noisy door swings wide:<br />
With chilling draft a student passes through.<br />
A pause; another student comes inside,<br />
Then finally, a third steps into view.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>All hustle-bustle has this floor become!<br />
These students do not speak with lowered voice!<br />
They act as if they call this place their home,<br />
And loudly claim they have no other choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, give me back my silent library!<br />
I loved her, boring as she seemed to be.</p>
