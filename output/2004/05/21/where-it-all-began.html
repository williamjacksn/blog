  <li>Tell a funny story about your first year in school.<br />
I tell this at my own peril!!! I was taught to raise my hand and wait for the teacher to call on me if I needed to say something. One day in kindergarten, I needed to say something, so I raised my hand and waited and waited and waited for the teacher to allow me to speak. When she finally did ask what I wanted to say, I told her, “I wanted to say that I needed to go to the bathroom, but now itʼs too late.”</li>
