<p>I learned something new today. Apparently, I am a “hard core Mormon boy”. Hard core, eh? Well, I suppose that phrase <em>could</em> apply. It wasnʼt really at the top of my list of ways to define myself, though. Perhaps it should be.</p>

<p>Hard core. I do <strong>wear khakis</strong> all the time (and I mean <em>all the time</em>). Thatʼs pretty hard core. Oh, and I <strong>part my hair in the middle</strong>. Watch out, Iʼm on the edge! My bicycle is a <strong>Liahona</strong>. That tag in the top left corner says “Property of California Sacramento Mission” (it belonged to my brother).</p>

<p>Need I say more? But I will … I own about <strong>two dozen ties</strong>. I could wear a different tie every day for almost a month and never repeat. This was a blessing when I <strong>served a mission</strong>, because I <em>did</em> wear a tie every day.</p>

<p>I have <strong>ten siblings</strong>, and they are all my best friends.</p>

<p>The voting appears to have been unanimous. Yes, I am a “hard core Mormon boy”, and have been so for a long time now. And I like it.</p>
