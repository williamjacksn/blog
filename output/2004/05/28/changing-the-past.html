  <li>What is your favorite childhood memory?<br />
The only thing I can remember from my childhood is my brother, and our good friendship.</li>
  <li>If you could be reincarnated as anything besides human, who would you want to be?<br />
I always wanted to fly, so some kind of bird is an obvious choice. I also thought that a turtle reflected my personality the best. Heʼs deliberate and thoughtful and patient. Iʼd like to be more like him.</li>
  <li>If you had to start your life all over, what are three things you would change?<br />
This is a tough question, and I might have to cop out and say that I would never change anything. But in the interest of The Friday Five, the three changes I would make are:
    <ol>
      <li>I would spend more time practicing the piano while I was young. I wish now more than anything that I had taken the time when I had it!</li>
      <li>I would say, “I love you,” to my parents and siblings more often.</li>
      <li>I would listen more.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If you had to forget everything in your life, except one thing, what would it be?<br />
I would never forget that God lives!</li>
  <li>Do you have a lucky charm?<br />
As people have flown into and out of my life, I have had many different “lucky charms”. They are usually connected with people. A dollar coin from my grandparents, a bracelet from a good friend, and even a ballpoint pen from a British bank have been “lucky” to me.</li>
</ol>
