<p>The Internet is devoid of humor. She has left us.</p>

<p>In a recent Google search on the word “funny”, the acclaimed search engine returned no results.</p>

<p>I can remember a time when jokes innumerable would flow into my inbox unwanted. I remember the Armless Legless Goatless boy from Bakalagaglooshen, and all the rupies and goatʼs milk he received because I forwarded that email to twenty of my friends who are no longer my friends because of it. I was willing to make that sacrifice in the name of humor! And it was funny!</p>

<p>Now, there is nothing. There is nothing to sacrifice for.</p>

<p>I remember the day AOL and Microsoft announced a merger, and Bill Gates wanted to share his fortune with the countless online masses. Yes, my friendʼs friendʼs uncleʼs roommateʼs cousinʼs legal advisor knew it was true, and I forwarded the email and waited for my check and lost some more friends, and laughed for days. And it was funny!</p>

<p>Now, there is nothing. There is nothing to laugh about.</p>

<p>Throw your lilies at the base of the stone that reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here Lies Humor<br />
The Internet Raised Her,<br />
The Internet Loved Her,<br />
The Internet Killed Her<br />
17 September 1973 ~ 2 June 2004</p>

<p>The day has come, citizens. We as a people have exhausted our precious resources. Hilarity is no more. In all seriousness, all things are now serious, and all this has come to pass on a quiet Wednesday morning.</p>
