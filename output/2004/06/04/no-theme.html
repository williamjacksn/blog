  <li>If the world were to suddenly end right now, what do you wish you would have done?<br />
I wish I would have seen it coming.</li>
  <li>How many times do you hit the snooze button before getting out of bed?<br />
Goose egg. Why waste life?</li>
  <li>What cartoon do you enjoy watching from the present (or the past)?<br />
The only cartoons I see anymore are <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>King of the Hill</em>.</li>
  <li>If you could go to any time and/or place in history, where/when would it be?<br />
Oh, I get it. I would go back to meet the man who invented essay questions and shoot him. Seriously, though, I would go to Fayette, New York, 6 April 1830, to witness the organization of <a href="http://www.mormon.org/">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>. As far as <em>living</em> goes, I just couldnʼt do without a computer. And the Internet. And lights. So anywhere/when with those items, and Iʼm good. I would also have to take all my friends along with me.</li>
  <li>If your life were a movie, what would it be rated and why?<br />
My life would be rated PG most of the time, and PG-13 occasionally. The rating would be different if you included the shower scenes.</li>
