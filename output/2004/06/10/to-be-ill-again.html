<p>I had some chicken noodle soup today. The taste reminded me of the last time I was ill. I loved missing school because of a fever. One time, I couldnʼt go to school for a whole week because my temperature was over 100°F. I didnʼt feel sick, I never vomitted, and I had no headache or stomach pain, put my fever would not go away so I wasnʼt allowed to go to school. It was wonderful.</p>

<p>P.S. I made some weblog upgrades, and now you can reply to <em>comments</em>!</p>
