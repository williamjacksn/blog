<p>Youʼre starring in a movie! Which celebrity will play …</p>

<ol>
  <li>you?<br />
Someone told me once that I look just like <a href="http://www.officialblue.com/profile_lee.html">Lee Ryan from the band Blue</a>, but Iʼm not so sure about that. A movie about me would be a musical, though, so there would of course be some singing and dancing going on. I donʼt think it would be too hard to act like me, so Iʼm looking for someone who looks somewhat like me. If that didnʼt matter, I would want Tom Hanks to play me, because he can play anything.</li>
  <li>your love interest?<br />
Meg Ryan. In fact, just call the movie <em>Youʼve Got Mail</em>. What a great movie. If Meg isnʼt available, call Helen Hunt. Then call the movie <em>Castaway</em>. And add some songs.</li>
  <li>your best friend?<br />
Tobey Maguire. He seems a down-to-earth guy, especially when he plays Peter Parker. Heʼs both cool and not-so-cool (I mean that in a good way!), and very real.</li>
  <li>your enemy?<br />
I donʼt have an enemy. What a boring movie!</li>
  <li>any family member?<br />
Michael Richards would play my brother. Heʼs spontaneous like that.</li>
</ol>

<p>On second thought, scratch all that and animate the thing.</p>
