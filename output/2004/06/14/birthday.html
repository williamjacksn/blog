<p>Everybody gather ʼround, itʼs story time.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about Chloë. Chloë is cool. I know the word “cool” sounds a bit cliché, but you must understand this: Chloë invented cool. Back in ʼ84, when she was born, no one knew how to describe her. Therefore, a new word was created. Thanks to Chloë, we can use the word “cool”.</p>

<p>This, however, is not the story of the word “cool”. This is the story of Chloëʼs twentieth birthday.</p>

<p>About a week before her birthday, Chloëʼs roommate Katie got together with some other friends and hatched a plot to throw a surprise party. Secrecy was of the utmost importance. As plans were finalized and a sufficient cover story was developed, Chloë had no clue what was in store for her.</p>

<p>The day came, and preparations were made including red velvet cake (Chloëʼs favorite) and key lime pie ice cream from Baskin Robbins (Chloëʼs favorite). Friends arrived and waited anxiously for her entrance.</p>

<p>Enter she did, and surprised she was, and happy. Fun was had by all.</p>

<p>The moral of this story is: donʼt be intimidated by the girl who invented cool. Sheʼs humble about it. Thatʼs what makes her so cool.</p>

<p>But the moral of this story could also be: know your friendsʼ favorite flavors of ice cream.</p>
