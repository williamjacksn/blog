<p>I am amused, but that doesnʼt take much. While working at the lab today, I experienced a problem. Every once in a while, we will lose access to any Internet sites outside of the utexas.edu domain. It just wonʼt connect.</p>

<p>When I first noticed that I was having problems accessing sites, I called “ITS Main” to see if they knew of an outage. They said they didnʼt see anything wrong, then transferred me to “the Operators” for more information.</p>

<p>“The Operators” told me that they didnʼt see any problems on the network, but also that I should talk to “OTS Operations” for Internet access questions. Transferred I was.</p>

<p>“OTS Operations” told me that there were no problems at the time, but then suggested that I might want to talk to someone else. My call was transferred again. At this point I tried to access another website, and it came up, so I assumed there was just a hiccough on the network, and all was well now. However, I wanted to be polite so I stayed on the line while my call was transferred.</p>

<p>The next voice I heard was a bit gruff, and said, “This is Mike.” Thatʼs all he said. From his tone and brevity I could tell he was the man I wanted to talk to at the beginning.</p>

<p>“My name is William, and I am a proctor at one of the ITS labs on campus. We were having some problems connecting to the web outside the utexas.edu domain, but everything seems to be fine now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there was a short outage but the network is running smoothly now.” Thatʼs the kind of answer I like.</p>

<p>So hereʼs to you, Mike. I donʼt know where your office is. I donʼt know your phone number, and it probably remains unlisted because if anyone knew about you, youʼd get no peace and quiet  But you made the transferred calls worth it. I raise my mouse to you.</p>
