<p>I just thought it necessary to warn everyone that I am an idiot. Please use caution when you are around me. I will act insensitive and stupid at times without notice and without reason. My priorities are completely out of line, often resulting in injurious and/or thoughtless actions.</p>

<p>Despite this warning I seek not to excuse myself. Please forgive me.</p>

<p>[Update 2004-06-21 14:33] I am being punished. I had a 30 minute break today, and I was going to get some food at the Union, but there was a fire alarm and the building was evacuated. I wasnʼt allowed to go into the Union. I didnʼt get anything to eat.</p>
