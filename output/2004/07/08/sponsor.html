<p>This weblog has been brought to you by Non-Ultra Dawn. <em>It始s not as strong as Ultra Dawn.</em> When you just don始t want your dishes to be their cleanest, there aren始t many products you can turn to. For the corner-cutter in all of us, there is Non-Ultra Dawn. This soap has been specially formulated to leave trace amounts of just about everything on just about anything. It can also be used as a shower gel for that just-woke-up-and-didn始t-take-a-shower feeling.</p>
