<p>I found a wonderful blogging tool today: <a href="http://wbloggar.com">w.bloggar</a>. It is a Windows program that I can use to post entries to my blog. I would normally have to log in using a web browser to post. I only wish it worked with LiveJournal, too. I use a separate program for that.</p>

<p>Well, at least I have one more toy to play with. I don始t really need it anyway, because my site (and subsequently my blog) is hosted on my own computer. If I wanted to, I could go into the database and manually insert weblog entries, but don始t let始s be silly. I始ll think of this as a trial so I can recommend this program to others in the future.</p>
