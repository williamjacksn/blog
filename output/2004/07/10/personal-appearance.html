<p>“Personal appearance” is the only thread I can see that runs through each random thought my mind is about to vomit onto the keyboard. Each thought triggers another, in true stream of consciousness style.</p>

<p>While I was shaving my face this morning – technically it was this afternoon, but thatʼs another story completely – I seriously considered leaving the goatee on again. It has been described as “artsy”, “Wesly-ish”, “chubes”, and “red”. I have never maintained facial hair before; either itʼs not there, or itʼs not maintained  Why should I start now?</p>

<p>I was fixing my hair this morning – technically it was this afternoon, but thatʼs the same other story completely – when I decided to give up. My hair is not parted today. I thought through a few options, but all I had available to put in it at the time was wax, my hands, and Non-Ultra Dawn. I used none. Thatʼs when I got the bright idea to wear a hat. I own several. There is one I especially like, a flat cap from England in a very drab brown color. It was perfect. Then my mind wandered to yesterday …</p>

<p>Yesterday I went up to the Arboretum (in an adventuresome way) to see Chloë in action at her work. She was wearing the cutest hat. I donʼt know what the name of the style is, but it was definitely tartan. And cute. So now I am disappointed that I am not allowed to wear a hat when I work at the lab.</p>

<p>But I did wear my flat cap on the bike ride <em>to</em> the lab, and I will wear it on the bike ride <em>from</em> the lab, and more and more until it has become an essential part of my identity.</p>
