<p>A weblog is a confusing thing. For example, during the 24 hour period commonly referred to as 7 July 2004, I made a total of five posts to this weblog. But, during the 216 hours immediately preceding that day, I made no posts whatsoever. Conclusion: I donʼt write in my weblog according to a reliable schedule.</p>

<p>In fact, and you may be alarmed to discover, I donʼt do much of anything according to a reliable schedule. Waking up and work are the obvious exceptions. I woke up at the same time yesterday as I did today. I went to work at the same time yesterday as I did today. I went to work at the same time last Monday and Tuesday as well. Employment is all about reliability.</p>

<p>Regarding sleep: if health is desired, sleep is all about reliability and schedule. Sleep at the same time every night. Your body will grow accustomed to the pattern, and complain emphatically when the pattern is broken.</p>

<p>But you knew that. But I knew you knew that. But I am just typing because I have nothing else to do, because I am at work. My employment is reliable. It is reliably uneventful, and reliably boring.</p>

<p>Pondering the subject I have laid out for myself here, I was considering the reliability of my sleeping patterns. I just realized that I do not remember the last time I awoke prematurely. Meaning, I lay down, fall asleep, then wake up when my alarm sounds, with nothing in between but slumber and rapid-eye-movement. My nights of late have been reliably restful.</p>
