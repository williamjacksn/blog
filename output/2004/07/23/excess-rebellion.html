<p>“Excess ainʼt rebellion,” she wrote.</p>

<p>I took great pains to analyze a particular subject yesterday, and the results of said analyzation can be read in the previous post. “And now, … I would ask if all is done?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay;” For all of my analyzation, I didnʼt learn a thing. This morning, because I didnʼt have to be at work, I didnʼt get out of bed at my regular time. I even set my alarm later than usual. I loafed. From when I got into my bed to when I got out, twelve hours elapsed. Twelve hours!</p>

<p>Excess of sleep <em>is</em> rebellion, and it feels so good.</p>
