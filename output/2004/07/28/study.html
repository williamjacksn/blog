<p>On the third floor of the Flawn Academic Center you will find a few things. You will find the Undergraduate Library stacks; you will find the Audio Visual Library; you will find the Multimedia Computer Facility; and you will find thermostats.</p>

<p>There are 20 thermostats in the main area of the floor. There may be more in the group study and media viewing rooms that line the walls. I surveyed the 20 thermostats to which I had access, and compiled a few statistics.</p>

<p>The maximum temperature was 74° Fahrenheit; four thermostats held this reading. The minimum was 66° F, which only registered on one thermostat, all the way in the corner of the building. The average temperature on the floor is 70.9° F.</p>

<p>I wear a jacket to work because itʼs so cold in the library. My fingernails are blue. If my fingers werenʼt always in motion on the keyboard, they would fall off.</p>
