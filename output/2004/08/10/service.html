<p>I was recently told that I look <strike>strikingly similar to</strike> like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079273/">Paul Bettany</a>. I have never seen one of his films, but I vaguely see a resemblance, and I play along with the idea for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am English.</li>
  <li>I can finally truthfully say I am six feet and three inches tall.</li>
  <li>I am acting opposite <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000379/">Kirsten Dunst</a> in a film about Wimbledon.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have previously made it known to many that I prefer Kirsten Dunst with red hair – perhaps itʼs just Mary Jane Watson I prefer – but this morning I realized just how shallow that is. Therefore, I have decided that I no longer have a Kirsten Dunst hair color preference.</p>

<p>My, sheʼs cute; and she has her hand on my face.</p>
