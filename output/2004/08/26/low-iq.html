<p>Two of my close friends were victimized by thieves in the past week. Judging
from their behavior (the thievesʼ), I have come to the conclusion that it
doesnʼt take a load of brains to steal stuff. Here are some examples of clever
thievery I have gleaned from my friendsʼ experiences.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Donʼt be seen. Both criminals succeeded in getting away with the goods
unnoticed. Iʼm surprised they had the sense to follow this step, though.</li>
  <li>If there are keys next to the target purse, donʼt bother. Of course there
will be no identifying material inside the purse that may lead you to a car
or apartment or house with which the keys might fit. Coincidentally, the
contents of the purse are <em>probably</em> more valuable than the contents of the
aforementioned car or apartment or house, anyway.</li>
  <li>If you manage to score a phone inside the purse, donʼt forget to answer it
when it rings. Who knows but what the owner of the purse is a drug dealer
and someone is trying to make a payment?</li>
  <li>Perhaps it would be better to return missed calls, too, especially if
someone called the phone about a dozen times the night it was stolen. They
obviously wanted to talk to someone or they wouldnʼt have called so many
times. The morning after the theft is a good time to do this.</li>
  <li>When you <em>do</em> return those calls, remember to make up a stupid alibi when
you are accused of stealing the purse. “I was working at a construction site
at 11:00 at night,” is a good one Iʼve heard recently.</li>
  <li>Lay low; donʼt make any purchases with the stolen credit/debit cards.
Someone somewhere might be able to track you somehow. I think.</li>
  <li>If you must buy something, go to places like Walgreenʼs and Payless, so as
not to draw attention to yourself. I think Payless is having that $5-$7-$9
sale at the moment, so go knock yourself out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: all of this actually happened.</p>
