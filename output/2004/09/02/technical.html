<p>You really, really donʼt need to read this.</p>

<p>Today I upgraded my content management software from version 3.01D to version 3.1. This new version was released yesterday, 1 September.</p>

<p>What this means for me: instead of actually upgrading the software, I opted to install the new version clean and transfer my weblog information from the old version. I spent way too much time working on this, exhausting time I could have been using to study or read for my classes.</p>

<p>What this means for you: because the threaded comments “feature” was in reality a hack, I decided not to try that again. Therefore, threaded comments are gone, and all comments that used to be threaded on older entries are no longer threaded.</p>

<p>What this means for the Internet in general: the “early adopter” count just increased by one.</p>
