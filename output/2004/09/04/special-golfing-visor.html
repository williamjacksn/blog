<p>Last night I went golfing and I wore my special golfing visor. I was invited to play with Lisa, Dean, Chloë and Katie. I have such wonderful friends! Most of the tournament was caught on camera. I think somebody won.</p>

<p>Then we raced lawnmowers around a track. Basically. Then we probably watched in horror as all the coin-games were turned off before our very eyes.</p>

<p>Then we went to Starseeds at midnight:30 and ate <em>the most delicious food all week</em>. And we took turns staring at each other, and generally acting as if it were midnight:30 at night. Then the night ended.</p>
