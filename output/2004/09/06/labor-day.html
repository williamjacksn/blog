<p>How a holiday such as today is properly spent has long been the subject<br />of prolonged argument and friendly dinner conversation. I have my<br />opinions, and doubtless you have yours. Should I choose to sleep in or<br />to arise early? That is the question I should ask of myself.<br /><br />It was really easy to answer that one. I woke up at 7:00 AM. I was<br />invited to play soccer down at Zilker Park with some of my friends. I<br />was kindly picked up at 8:30 and arrived at the park at 9:00. The play<br />was great, and the sun was shining brightly. I got exhausted rather<br />quickly; I haven ºt played soccer or engaged in any intense physical<br />activity for quite some time now, and I was not used to it. My body was<br />reminded how to sweat.<br /><br />I also squeezed in a few minutes of good tree-climbing time.<br /><br />As my friend drove me home at 11:30, rain began to fall. Hard. The rain<br />gave off that pleasant rain-smell that I love. The earth, the air, the<br />sky and everything smells so fresh and clean when the rain comes.</p>
