<p>I miss the carefree feeling that comes when you ask your friends, “What are we going to do tonight?” I miss the thick, black and unyielding line separating work and play. I miss the weeks that roll up into mere days, the days that disappear just as quickly and silently. I miss the consecutive hours spent with friends, on adventures.</p>

<p>Every summer I take out the child in me, brush away the dust, wind him up and let him run. Every autumn that child goes right back in the drawer next to my swimming trunks and sunblock.</p>
