<p>I don ºt particularly enjoy being frustrated with the police.</p>

<p>I was standing at the Baja Fresh corner (northwest), and I wanted to cross Guadalupe. I waited for my walking man to light up so I could be a good citizen and cross when it was my turn. Just as the Guadalupe traffic light was turning amber, this police cruiser pulled up, intending to make a left turn onto 21<sup>st</sup> Street. The light turned red, and the police car was sitting in the middle of <em>my</em> crosswalk. Those officers looked oblivious, too.</p>

<p>I was so unhappy about having to walk around the car that I took a picture as soon as I got to the other side of the street.</p>
