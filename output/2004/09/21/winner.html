<p>I woke up three days ago with the best idea for a flash cartoon: Awarding Nobel
prizes in the style of the Academy Awards, or if youʼre daring, the MTV Movie
Awards.</p>

<p>Stephen Hawking would MC.</p>

<p>“This yearʼs Nobel Prize in Chemistry goes to … Professor von
Bruenhousen, for his work identifying inherent chemical differences between
Texans and other Americans! Thatʼs as awesome as those full-color illustrations
of light cones in my <em>Brief History of Time</em>!”</p>

<p>“Iʼd like to thank the University, and all the little people who volunteered for
my tests. And the Texans, too.”</p>

<p>Well, the idea seemed really funny when I woke up that morning.</p>
