<p>I hope I can remember all the wonderful little things that happened today, because today was entirely made up of wonderful little things. Nothing was absolutely huge, but it was all great.</p>

<p>My lip is getting worse. I think thatʼs awesome.</p>

<p>I worked 08:00 to 11:00 as normal. I powerwalked to E 316K in the stadium, as normal. When my English class was over, I decided to wait on the bridge at the corner of 23rd Street and San Jacinto, because I knew Chloë would be passing by on her way to class, and I wanted to say “hello” to her.</p>

<p>So, I was standing on the bridge, peering down into the creek, when I realized how beautiful it looked and sounded. I knew there were students behind me busily making their way to classes, but I wasnʼt paying any attention to them.</p>

<p>Jared came by. That was cool. He left, and I waited a while longer. I was sitting on the bridge wall now, and sure enough, I heard Chloëʼs voice call my name. She gave me a hug and said, “I love that shirt.” I returned the hug and said, “I love that hat.” Then she went to class, and I went home, my mission accomplished. That was <strong>wonderful moment number one</strong>.</p>

<p>I was back in class at 14:00. C S 349, or <em>Contemporary Issues in Computer Science</em>. We had a test today, short answer, ten questions. I finished it in thirty minutes. That was <strong>wonderful moment number two</strong>.</p>

<p>Itʼs Tuesday, so I had Menʼs Chorus rehearsal. That was <strong>wonderful 80 minutes number three</strong>.</p>

<p>On my walk home from the Music Recital Hall, I saw a blue thing on the ground. I took notice of it and wonderered what it might be as I walked away. When I realized what it was, I went back to take a photo. It was one of those blue sheets Chloë uses to blot oil off her face. I saw it and I was reminded of her. That was <strong>wonderful moment number four</strong>.</p>

<p>From home, I took the bus to the Institute. On the bus a crazy woman sang a Southern Baptist hymn. I was smiling at her the whole time, and she knew it. It was really beautiful, and I count the experience as <strong>wonderful moment number five</strong>. I took her hand and thanked her as I got off the bus.</p>

<p>Institute is always wonderful. Learning about women in Jesusʼ genealogy was <strong>wonderful moment number six</strong>.</p>

<p>After my Institute class I went to Wendyʼs with Larissa and Theresa. We had a great time, and giggled a lot. We also put on our best English accents for the walk back to the Institute. I probably let a few cats out of a few bags, with no harm done. Rack up <strong>wonderful moment number seven</strong>. Back at the Institute, one of my friends said to me, “You still have some sauce on your lip.”</p>

<p>“No man, thatʼs definitely a bruise.”</p>

<p>Add to all this a guy at the Institute asking every woman in sight, “Are you hooked up?” and you have yourself an awesome day!</p>
