<p>Even though I wear a suit to church on Saturday like my dad, I like computers like my dad, I laugh at the same things as my dad, I enjoy photography like my dad, and I donʼt get enough sleep and nod off during <a href="http://lds.org/broadcast/gc/about/0,6223,5394-1,00.html">General Conference</a> like my dad, all this does <em>not</em> mean I am a responsible adult like my dad.</p>

<p>This past weekend when I went home to visit (whatʼs left of) my family, my father was running the show. My mother went to stay with my sister for a week, because she just had her first child. Eva is a cutie! I would have pictures, but I left them in Waco.</p>

<p>See? Now wasnʼt that an unresponsible thing to do?</p>

<p>I also forgot to bring the power cord to my telephone back with me. If I donʼt answer my phone this week, itʼs because either I have it turned off to conserve battery power, or it is already dead. Unresponsibility abounds.</p>

<p>But hey, the weekend was très cool, even when I consider just how much time I spent at “home”.</p>

<p>Jared dropped me at my home at about 16:45. After many hugs and dinner, and my dad returning from work, we all piled into the car and departed for my sisterʼs home at 19:30. Three hours later we pulled into her driveway. I took pictures as everyone (except you-know-who-you-are) held little Eva. Then we all got back in the car with one less mother and drove back to Waco. And slept.</p>

<p>Saturday morning, I was up at 09:30 and at the chapel with my father and three youngest brothers at 11:00. Session One was excellent; <a href="http://lds.org/newsroom/showrelease/0,15503,3881-1-20240,00.html">two new apostles</a>, <a href="http://lds.org/newsroom/showrelease/0,15503,3881-1-20241,00.html">another temple in the Salt Lake Valley</a>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At 13:00 we went home for lunch, then back up to the chapel at 15:00. Session Two was excellent; Dad: “This is the first time Iʼve sustained an apostle younger than me!”</p>

<p>At 17:00 we went home for dinner, then we left the youngest at home on the computer while we went back to the chapel at 19:00 for Session Three; lots of good counsel and rebukement (rebuketion?).</p>

<p>Then at 21:00, home and sleep.</p>

<p>Sunday morning was a similar story. Awake at 10:00, Session Four at 11:00, lunch, Session Five at 15:00. Jared came to pick me up at 18:15 or so, and we drove to Austin in the rain.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>You know, my dad isnʼt such a bad guy to want to be like.</p>
