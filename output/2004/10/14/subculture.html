<p>I am so mainstream that I went to take the <a href="http://quizilla.com/users/arsenicsugar/quizzes/Which%20Subculture%20Are%20You%3F/">Which Subculture Are You Quiz</a>, and none of the questions had answers that I could honestly choose. Six questions, seven answers apiece: forty-two radio buttons, and not a single one applied to me.</p>

<p>Okay, I may be exaggerating a bit; but Question One was, “Some Bands That You Listen To Include:” and “The Postal Service” and “Death Cab for Cutie” were listed in different choices. I was as confused as cheese on a peanut butter sandwich.</p>

<p>Question Three, “Some Words To Describe You Are:” could have been answered thusly: “Quiet, Intelligent, &amp; Independent”. However, I try not to refer to myself as intelligent although others have told me I am, and I donʼt really think Iʼm all that independent either.</p>

<p>And I most certainly would never put a comma after the word “Intelligent” in that context.</p>
