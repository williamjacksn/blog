<p>Last night I dreamed of Alicia.</p>

<p>Alicia is a girl. Alicia is a girl I have not spoken to in four years. I really have no idea why my dream featured the surprise appearance of this girl. I do not know what prompted the thought.</p>

<p>The dream itself was simple. I was somewhere. I rarely know exactly where I am in dreams. This particular somewhere included an open area, like a big room, with a ledge on one wall. The ledge was about ten feet from the floor, and I was sitting on the ledge observing the activity in the room from above. The place resembled a large, clean garage, or a small hangar of some sort. The place was very clean.</p>

<p>Jared was there. He wasnʼt on the ledge; he was on the floor of the room, or garage, or hangar. A car pulled in out of nowhere, and stopped. The doors opened and two girls got out. I recognized both of these girls: Jessica and Alicia. They were in my high school graduating class.</p>

<p>In my dream, it must have been the same four years that I had not been in contact with them, because I felt overwhelmed with happiness at the sight of them. Jared knew them, too, and hugged them as they got out of the car. I continued to look on from my perch on the ledge.</p>

<p>Then, Alicia looked up and saw me sitting there. She smiled. I jumped down (from ten feet up – I donʼt know how) and went to give her a hug. I gave her a juicy hug, and the reunion brought me to tears.</p>

<p>What a weird dream.</p>

<p>In high school, Alicia was the first girl I had a crush on. We were in the same French class for two years. We were both French Club officers, and she would give me a ride home from our meetings after school. She was a cheerleader. I was scared out of my mind to say anything to her.</p>

<p>Jared knew I had a crush on her. One night, when we were driving around town, Jared said to me, “Iʼve got a good idea!” He failed to tell me what that good idea might be. We went to pick up another mutual friend, and then Jared drove to the home of Alicia. I knew exactly what was going on.</p>

<p>Jared and the other guy dragged me, probably kicking and trying not to make much noise, to Aliciaʼs front door. They rang the bell, and I was just standing there. Her father opened the door, and I asked if Alicia was home.</p>

<p>She wasnʼt; she was cheering at a basketball game that night.</p>

<p>I was saved.</p>
