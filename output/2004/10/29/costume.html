<p>Today, the employees at my workplace were encouraged, or rather allowed, to dress up in some costume-type thing. When I left my apartment I had my hair slicked back and firmly hair-sprayed in place. I was wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans with the pant legs rolled up past my ankle bones. I was wearing black socks and black shoes. I claimed to be some random guy from the 50s or something.</p>

<p>Before too long, one of my coworkers suggested that I look more like a geek than anything else, so I took the liberty of taping up my glasses to complete the effect. This photo – in which I am smiling, take note – appears upon request of Inbar.</p>
