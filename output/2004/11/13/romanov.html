<p>This is a quickie, so I donʼt forget.</p>

<p>Chloë invited me to dinner with some of her friends. The temptation to take up residence at Northcastle is growing. All I need is a car. Christmas is around the corner! Iʼll put “car” on my list.</p>

<p>The next time you eat strawberries, be certain you know whether or not they are covered in brandy. Beware the French (and the Russians).</p>

<p>I also was invited to go dancing with friends. Oh yeah. Salsa isnʼt just hot and spicy, itʼs hot and spicy <em>and</em> got a good beat (and excellent for keeping the cold weather away). Then there was rolling down the big hill until we were sufficiently dizzy. At least I felt sober when I was driving.</p>

<p>I have got to get some stars in my bedroom.</p>

  <p>Hereʼs the explanation:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Thursday night Chloë invited me to dinner with friends. We went to a cozy little French bistro-type place called La Madeleine. It was my first time, my La Madeleine de-virginization, and one of the servers offered me some Strawberries Romanov. I asked him what it was, and could have sworn he said it contained brandy. Naturally, upon learning this information, I declined.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of the meal, Chloë decided that she wanted some dessert, so she went to get some and when she came back, there was Strawberries Romanov in her hand. I told her what my understanding of the dish was, and she (and Katie) said that couldnʼt be true, because someone had brought such a dish to one of our church dinners one time.</p>
