<p>This morning when I woke up and started my daily Internet rounds, I noticed a bunch of strange comments on my weblog. Spam! Ever since I started this site, I have read in various forums and on other weblogs about people getting comment spammed, or getting a load of comments advertising drugs or Texas Hold ʼEm. I had never seen it before on my own site.</p>

<p>Until today! I deleted 18 comments this morning. Itʼs not much, really, considering I hadnʼt implemented any anti-spam features here. I guess Iʼm lucky.</p>

<p>And in need of help for my Texas Hold ʼEm game.</p>
