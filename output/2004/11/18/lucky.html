<p>Hi, my name is William and Iʼm employed. How lucky can one guy be?</p>

<p>Hi, my name is William and my bed is so comfortable (Iʼd let you give it a try, but Iʼm afraid I might get scabies). Itʼs soft and warm, and thereʼs even a Sesame Street blanket someone made for me when I was born.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is William and about four years ago I applied to study at a certain university. Said application was accepted. How many people in the world get that chance? Out of everyone in the world who applied to this university, I was one of the few accepted. Why did it work out that way?</p>

<p>Hi, my name is William and I was born with best friends. Five of them. Then five more came along later on. Weʼre still best friends. And hereʼs a shout-out to the siblings. Donʼt forget the two most loving and best parents in the world, which belong to me, and numerous extended family members to whom I am not ashamed, but rather ecstatic to be related. Why did it work out that way?</p>

<p>Hi, my name is William and God loves me.</p>
