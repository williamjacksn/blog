<p>I think thereʼs a new guard at the library.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning, I didnʼt recognize the library guard when I came in to
open the computer lab. For the life of me I couldnʼt reach the key. I
could hear it down there when I moved books around – as a matter of security, I
donʼt think I can tell you where the key is actually kept – but I just
couldnʼt find it. I went to ask the guard if he could go get the key for
me.</p>

<p>He said he didnʼt have access to that area, and the librarians who did
have access didnʼt arrive until eight oʼclock in the morning (it
was 7:45 at the time). I tried to explain that I worked for ITS and I needed to
open the computer lab before 8, and all the other guards would go get the key
for me when I couldnʼt get it for myself, but I gave up and decided to
try one more time to get the key on my own. I succeeded, thankfully.</p>

<p>That was Tuesday morning. This morning, the same guard was working. And he
carded me.</p>

<p><em>He carded me</em>!</p>

<p>There is a sign that clearly indicates that I should be prepared to show a
University ID card to enter the library “between the hours of 10PM and 7AM,” and
this was most definitely <em>not</em> between the hours of 10PM and 7AM. And do I look
like Iʼm just some guy off the street interested in a warm,
semi-comfortable couch and a good read?</p>

<p>So back off, man. I donʼt even use this library to study. Ever.
Iʼm just the guy up on the third floor to whom everyone comes for
library-related advice, and I reply that I donʼt work for the library,
but Iʼll help them anyway.</p>

<p>Read the badge. I work for ITS.</p>
