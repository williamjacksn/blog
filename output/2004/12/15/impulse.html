<p>Thatʼs right, impulse. And Iʼm not talking about subwarp speeds, Captain Picard.</p>

<p>Completely on impulse, I went to Waco for two days. I was helping my friend pack his things for the winter break, when I looked at my schedule – Iʼm never without my schedule, it helps prevent impulsiveness – and realized that I was doing nothing, <em>nothing</em> for two days. So we stopped at my apartment and I packed up a bag quickly and we were on the road to Waco!</p>

<p>Iʼm starting to shop impulsively, too. Perhaps thatʼs just Christmas coming to get me, though. I have so many people that I want to get things for, especially because I have been forgetting birthdays left, right and center the entire year. And somehow, I have the funds. It must be a blessing.</p>

<p>So, “Merry Christmas” to all. And donʼt forget to impulsively wear clothing you havenʼt worn since you were fourteen years old. Now, whoʼs up for a Pinewood Derby?</p>
