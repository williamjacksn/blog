<p>On the Saturday evening of December 4 just past, I was at the LDS
Institute of Religion. That evening, many young people gathered to make
gingerbread houses and watch a performance. The “gingerbread” was really
graham crackers, but the performance was real. I was privileged to be a
part of “The Forgotten Carols” by Michael McLean.</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>As I was observing the graham cracker house making, I ate some
chocolate. This was not an abnormal practice of mine. In fact, it was
quite in the ordinary for me to ingest chocolate on occasion. Quite as
much in the ordinary as the next man, naturally. The <em>real</em> excitement
comes later.</p>

<p>The following Wednesday, being December 8, I was at work talking with Inbar.
We have a tin of candy at work to which we can help
ourselves at any time. I was in the act of helping myself to a
<a href="http://www.reeses.com/products/pbcups.asp">Reeseʼs® Peanut Butter Cup</a>, when Inbar
mentioned that she thought she was addicted to chocolate. After her
explanation, I was thoroughly convinced that she was indeed addicted to
chocolate, and I suggested she stop eating it.</p>

<p>She certainly wouldnʼt have any of that. I told her that I would stop,
too. And I did. I replaced the Reeseʼs® Peanut Butter Cup without
opening it. But she didnʼt. Stop, that is. So now Iʼm not eating
chocolate for no reason whatsoever. And Iʼm actually enjoying it!
However, the <em>real</em> excitement comes later.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I found myself again at work, and I was on shift with
Inbar, when our supervisor walked over to our desk from her
office with a large (that is to say, <em>large</em>) slice of cake. She offered
it to us, and I began to laugh. And Inbar began to laugh.
Because the cake was <em>the most chocolatest chocolate cake with chocolate
frosting I have ever seen in my entire life</em>!</p>

<p>And yes, Inbar enjoyed it.</p>
