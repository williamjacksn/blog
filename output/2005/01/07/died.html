<p>Actually, Iʼm sure a lot of people would be curious if I didnʼt answer
my phone for a while and didnʼt show up to Church on Sunday and missed
work on Monday. I sure hope Aaron would assume something was wrong if I
didnʼt come home without letting him know.</p>

<p>Okay okay okay, so there are some people that love me. I guess Iʼll just
have to accept that. But donʼt letʼs look at the big picture for the
moment, and letʼs talk about how boring my afternoon has been.</p>

<p>On the other hand, donʼt letʼs talk about how boring my afternoon has
been until we talk about how exciting my morning was. It was sprinkling.
Hoorah. I caught my bus, which I havenʼt done all week because I insist
on reading the Internet for an hour before I even get in the shower.
Itʼs a good thing I caught my bus, too, because it was sprinkling, and a
wet William, as one would assume, is not necessarily a pleasant William.</p>

<p>Continuing with the excitement, I mentored a new employee at the lab.
Heʼs cool. Also, when I went to the <em>other</em> lab to work at noon, I
scanned some slides from 1983/4. I understand now why everyone thought
my brother and I were identical twins. I could hardly tell which one was
me! This is not quite so evident in the supplied photograph. Trust me.</p>

<p>At this point I have forgotten why I was so bored. All I know is that I
was bored enough to stick my face in one of the flatbed scanners. It
really is gross. Iʼm not sure why it is red, but I think my nose looks
like a strawberry. And isnʼt that lip-scar just awesome?</p>

<p>Mmmm, strawberries.</p>
