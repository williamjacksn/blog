<p>I often strongly feel I must validate my existence. I wish I could write
like Jane Austen. I do not eat chocolate. I can interest myself in
anything. Difficult video games frustrate me. Music escapes my lips at
appropriate times. I use computers more often than I should. I hold
little respect for a person with a tendency to irrationally split
infinitives. Three quarters of my jokes do not provoke laughter. I
prefer active verbs. I spell correctly and correct spelling errors.</p>

<p>I completed Oregon Trail in the fourth grade. I use the keyboard to open
the  WindowsÂ® Start menu. I have heard of HTML entities and I know
how to use them. Mavis Beacon did not teach me typing. I might have a
lower GPA than you. I cannot touch my toes without bending my knees. I
read instruction manuals. Music escapes my lips at inappropriate times.
I write with my left hand. I never got chicken pox, and I never will.
Macintosh computers do not scare me.</p>

<p>I wrote a sonnet once. I do not know the difference between Unix and
Linux. I can juggle three bean bags. I sleep on my back. I have never
had stitches or broken a bone. I never owned a dog. I grew up in a
two-story house. I twitch. I love my parents. My eyes betray me.</p>
