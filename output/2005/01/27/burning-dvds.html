<p>Iʼm so excited to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/"><em>Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</em></a>
that I am going to stay awake until it hits theatres in May. I really
should be in bed right now. I should be sleeping, because I have to be
at work early in the morning.</p>

<p>At first glance I would definitely think nothing exciting happened
today. It rained all day. I love rain. I love Texas, because it rains
instead of snows in the winter. I went to class, and had the pleasure of
running into friends along the way. It makes me feel good when I can
randomly cross paths with someone I know on a campus of almost 50,000
students. Actually, I bumped (figuratively) into the same girl twice
today.</p>

<p>I also went to work today, at which I brushed up on my knowledge of
scanning and text recognition on the Macs; and my Photoshop skills
(displayed herein). Girls only want boyfriends with good skills, and I
think my computer hacking skills are coming along quite nicely.</p>

<p>Yesterday I burned a DVD for the very first time, ever. I took the
production of “The Forgotten Carols” that I played a small part in,
exported it from VHS to a computer, then burned it onto one of these
Digital Versatile Discs. Everything appeared fine, but there are some
parts on the DVD that are messed up <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/sbemail91.html">like Strong Sad on caffeine</a>.
Looks like Iʼll have to do it all over again. The only catch is that it
takes ninety minutes to get the movie from the video tape onto the
computer, because it has to play at normal speed. And it takes three
hours to burn the movie onto a DVD. The import process automatically
cuts the video into segments of about ten minutes in length, so it takes
thirty minutes to an hour in between to set up the movie clips and get
the DVD menus right. Iʼd have to be at the computer lab all day!</p>

<p>Itʼs not like that has never happened.</p>
