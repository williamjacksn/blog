<p>8.8/10. I just rated my day. <a href="http://www.xanga.com/mary_jay/195007212/item.html">My sistersʼ habits</a> are rubbing
off on me.</p>

<p>Of course, I completely understand how premature it is of me to rate the
day before it is over. Any number of good and/or bad occurences could
change this score before sundown. Or midnight, depending on your
reckoning. And the word on the street is I have some serious bad luck
coming, because yesterday I was walking around the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/fac.html">Flawn Academic
Center</a> with my umbrella wide open. Everyone knows itʼs healthier
for an umbrella to dry wide open.</p>

<p>Why didnʼt I give today a nice, round nine? Because I havenʼt done
anything extremely interesting. I started work at 07:45 and have been
here ever since. I ate <a href="http://www.tacobell.com/">Taco Bell</a> for lunch. It isnʼt raining
anymore. Rain would definitely have pulled the score up at least a tenth
of a point.</p>

<p>Well, why didnʼt I give today a nice, round eight? Because todayʼs got
potential. I am reburning the DVD of which I spoke previously, because
there were some problems with it. Iʼm hoping everything will be better
this time around. Iʼm definitely hopeful. Definitely.</p>

<p>[Update 2005-01-28 16:00] Success! Iʼm tempted to bump the score to 9.0,
but letʼs not be hasty.</p>
