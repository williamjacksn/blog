</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Whereas</strong> they are ranked 5 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches poll, 6 in the AP poll, and 5 in the Bowl Championship Series poll; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Whereas</strong> they have defeated both the Big XII North Champion (University of Colorado) and the Sun Belt Conference Champion (University North Texas); and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Whereas</strong> they have defeated 3 top 25 BCS teams (Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, and Oklahoma State); and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Whereas</strong> the UT football team is the only team to be ranked in the final BCS poll for the past 6 years; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Whereas</strong> the Big XII South has 5 teams ranked in the BCS top 25.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Therefore Be It Resolved</strong> the Students at the University of Texas encourage all voting coaches and writers to vote for the UT football team; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Be It Further Resolved</strong> UT stands behind their football team and congratulates them on their fourth straight 10 win season; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Be It Further Resolved</strong> this resolution is to be sent immediately to all writers, coaches, BCS executives, Conference commissioners, President Faulkner, and Coach Mack Brown.</p>
