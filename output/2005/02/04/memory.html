<p>I feel so bad! Yesterday I was meandering down the hallway in <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/wel.html">Robert A.
Welch Hall</a>, when I heard someone say my name. I looked up and
recognized her face, but couldnʼt remember from where. I decided to be
honest and avoid beating around any nearby bushes, so I said,</p>

<p>“I feel really bad. I know you, but I donʼt remember your name.”</p>

<p>She told me her name, and even then, I had to think for two seconds
before I could place her. This was a girl I saw at most once a week for
about a month and a half. It had been at least three months since I had
seen her last.</p>

<p>This occurred early in the morning. She said, “You probably didnʼt
recognize me because Iʼm wearing glasses and I look like crap.”</p>

<p>Iʼll buy the glasses comment, because they <em>did</em> make her look
different. But why do so many girls think that just because itʼs before
11 AM, they are wearing a University hoodie, and lack makeup, that they
“<a href="http://nts.umd.edu/~mark/bed_head.jpg">look like crap</a>”?</p>

<p>Every girl (and by “every” I mean “<em>every</em>”) that has ever told me that
has been dead wrong.</p>
