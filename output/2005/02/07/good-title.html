<p>Today I went to Family Home Evening at the stake center instead of my
usual place. I always start with the end of the day, and skip the
beginning. Let me start over.</p>

<p>I worked for at least seven hours today. I was going to mentor four new
employees at the lab (four in one day–a new record!) but one had to
postpone. Three new employees mentored in one day–a new record! This
meant I did a lot of talking. I talked for at least four full hours
cumulatively, and that was just at work. This meant I drank a lot of
water. I think I drank too much water, because I began to feel sick.
Ick.</p>

<p>After work I went to Institute class. I was really tired, and I fell
asleep on my desk. This was another incident when I was sitting on the
front row. My instructor is kind enough to never mention it to me, but
at least two (2) of the other students asked me if I got enough sleep
last night. Of course I didnʼt. <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> is robbing me of my
slumber.</p>

<p>A particularly kind Hispanic woman offered me a ride home, which I
whole-heartedly accepted because I hadnʼt seen or spoken with the
aforementioned Hispanic woman for over a month. <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail123.html">“Hot time!” said
William.</a> Once home, I whipped up some of my famous homemade Ramen
noodle soup. Mmmmm (sp?). My friend who was going to drive to Family
Home Evening came ten minutes early, so she checked out all her emails
while I finished up all my Ramens.</p>

<p>Then it was onward and upward to Family Home Evening, where the lesson
was effectively entitled, “Prayer; How many bars do you have?” Clever
and meaningful it was, yes, clever and meaningful. We attempted to play
life-sized foosball (keyword: attempted) then either finished the game
or gave up, depending on your perspective, and settled for some
delicious frozen custard. When everyone started leaving, an impromptu
basketball game picked up amongst eight people; I was one of the eight.
Surprise surprise. Impromptu basketball is not to be confused with
improvisational comedy, neither of which I am very good at.</p>

<p>So my foot got sore, and my shirt got ripped, and my breath got knocked,
but I had a good time. For the most part it was girls v. boys. I was on
the girlsʼ team.</p>

<p>On the ride home I found myself (a) pumping gas for my driver, (b)
cleaning my driverʼs windshield, and (c) explaining to my driver the
difference between deterministic and nondeterministic finite state
machines. If you ask me, vending machines are key.</p>

<p>Because you made it thus far, oh thou loyal reader, I shall now explain
the photograph. ʼTwas her birthday, and she is a dear friend, and thatʼs
how I show my love for dear friends on their birthdays. Even if it
wasnʼt her birthday, people who know HTML have a special bond.</p>
