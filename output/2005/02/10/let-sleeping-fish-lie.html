<p>One of my sisters – the one that got translated into Spanish – married a
really cool guy last July. It was July, so the colors for her wedding
reception were blue and red. My mother already owned a red betta at the
time, so she purchased three more: one red and two blue.</p>

<p>These fish went in little fish bowls on the tables at the reception, and
really added to the atmosphere of the place. I mean, live fish on the
tables? How cool is that?</p>

<p>So anyway, when the reception was over, my sister gave me one of the
fish, a blue one named Violet.</p>

<p>Violet was a trooper. It was two weeks before I got him a decent
fishbowl, and even then I neglected him every chance I got. I probably
didnʼt feed him as much as I should have. I didnʼt change his water
often enough. I left him in Austin when I visited my parents for two
weeks over the winter break. Sometimes I would even leave my webcam
pointed at him all day, so Iʼm sure that stressed him out some.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, Violet is free from the suffering that I deserved
because of the way I treated him.</p>

<p>However, I will always wonder, because Violet wasnʼt floating. I was
always told that dead fish float. Was he just taking a three-day nap?</p>

<p>Now what? I have a fish bowl. Iʼm going to use it to hold the matchbooks
I am beginning to collect.</p>

<p>Happy Chinese New Year, Violet.</p>
