<p>I really like the new proctors this semester. I have mentored them all,
and worked several hours with most of them. I was looking forward to
many enjoyable hours proctoring the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/smf/">SMF</a> with all my new coworkers.
This is why it pains me to know that one of them is being transferred to
the (villainous) <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/computer/labs/ccc/">Communication Computer Center</a>.</p>

<p>She didnʼt think it was such a good idea, either.</p>

<p>I tried to cheer her up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thereʼs nothing wrong with working at the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/computer/labs/ccc/">CCC</a>. Some proctors would
rather work there than here at the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/smf/">SMF</a>. Most proctors would rather
work there than here. Okay, every proctor I have ever met except me
would rather work there instead of here at the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/smf/">SMF</a>. Itʼs more
laid-back, you get to study when itʼs quiet, …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the risk you take when you enter this business. You could be
transferred at a momentʼs notice. Itʼs all part of the Proctor
lifestyle.</p>

<p>My dear fellow proctor, I wish you all happiness and smiles as you brave
this new territory.</p>
