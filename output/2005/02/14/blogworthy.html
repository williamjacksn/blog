<p>I warn you, Iʼm talking about things that occur in restrooms (again).</p>

<p>I went to the menʼs room on the second floor of the Flawn Academic
Center, to do what people do in menʼs rooms. When I exited my stall, I
saw a man walk away from one of the urinals with a book in his hand.</p>

<p><em>He had a book in his hand!</em></p>

<p>He walked straight to the door. Thatʼs right, he forgot to sanitize. I
stood there, utterly dumbfounded by the surrealism of what I had just
witnessed. I recognized him, too. He works here. Iʼm never shaking his
hand. Ever.</p>

<p>In related news, I remember my friend mentioning to me how spacious the
handicap stalls are. “Theyʼre nice and roomy,” he said. “I could set up
shop in there.”</p>

<p>“Set up shop?” I donʼt even want to know what he meant by that.</p>
