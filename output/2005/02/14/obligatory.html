<p>Lisa suggested – no, <em>insisted</em> – that I mention something that happened
Saturday night.</p>

<p>We had left the <a href="http://myec.net/">Millennium Youth Entertainment Complex</a> and were in
some residential neighborhood looking for a particular house, where we
would be watching a movie with friends. I noted the house numbers and
informed the driver that we were going in the wrong direction and needed
to turn around. As she pulled into some random driveway, the headlights
of her car illuminated a young man standing with his face to the wall of
the house there. He appeared to be urinating, but I canʼt be certain.</p>

<p>I can, however, be certain of the uncontrollable laughter that escaped
our lips.</p>

<p>I could take a moment to put myself in his shoes and try to understand
how he felt about this, but I wonʼt. Iʼd rather discuss what I was doing
at the Millennium Youth Entertainment Complex Saturday night. I was
bowling.</p>
