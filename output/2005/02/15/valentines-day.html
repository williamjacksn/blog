<p>A day late and a dollar short, I wanted to wait until my Valentineʼs Day
was over before I commented on how much I loved it. At his very moment
Iʼm rather overwhelmed at the happiness I seem to be displaying in the
picture. I didnʼt realize at the time how content my smile made me look.
It was a happy day, for some reason.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the picture a small red smudge is visible. Thatʼs
sweetʼnʼsour sauce from Hoa Hoa, the best Chinese restaurant in Dobie
Mall, and the cheapest, and the only. I have a weekly lunch date there.
The sweetʼnʼsour sauce is always good, but this time I decided to take
some with me, obviously. I also ate the obligatory fortune cookie, and
one can faintly make out the fortune taped to my shirt just below the
fading barcode. Weʼll get to that in a minute.</p>

<p>To the right is a blue smiling heart. That was a gift from one of my
coworkers. Thank you!</p>

<p>Goodness, I have skinny arms. Anyway, on to the fortune:</p>
