<p>I was proctoring the biggest lab in the world, and I was all by myself.
Suddenly, I realized that it was time to close! I quickly announced that
the lab was closed and everyone had to leave. Hundreds of people started
madly rushing for the doors. I slipped into a stairwell, went down a few
flights, and came out on a balcony overlooking some large classroom. The
walls were painted dark, the lights were low and half a dozen students
were sitting in a broken circle around <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000164/">Anthony Hopkins</a>. One of the
students was a friend of mine, and she was asking him something.</p>

<p>I left that room and went down some more stairs and out a door that
opened to a parking lot. I met some people I knew from England, chatted
with them for a minute or two, then told them I needed to get back to
work.</p>

<p>I entered the stairwell again, and on the way up I noticed that there
were backpacks scattered all over the stairs. When I got back up to my
enormous lab, there were still hundreds of people milling about. Once
again, I anounced that the lab was closed and everyone needed to go
home. Once again, people started running for the exit.</p>

<p>Then, like your stereotypical immature fratboy college sophomore, some
guys started taking books and writing all over them. I tried to be nice
and ask them to stop, but they soon decided they didnʼt want to leave,
and turned on me.</p>

<p>I got away from them somehow, and ran up some open stairs, so I could
still see the huge room. When I got to the first landing, I was on the
verge of tears because I had lost complete control of the lab and I had
a mob of angry fratboy college sophomores on my heels. Suddenly, I
looked up and was overwhelmingly relieved to be looking into the eyes of</p>

<p>I have a hard time remembering dreams, especially when I wait so long to
write them down. I donʼt remember who I saw.</p>
