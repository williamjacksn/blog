<p>As some have already discovered, I traveled to Waco to visit my family
this past weekend. So many exciting things and blogworthy happened, that
I had to take notes because I did not have access to a computer. I also
have pictures.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/8tjeslp43pzfg3c/20050221-cool-bros.jpg" alt="Cool brothers" /></p>

<p>To begin, my brothers are the coolest brothers. When I arrived at the
residence of my parents, my parents were not there, but these guys were
(sans the short one). We cleaned the house, then went to the library. Of
course, none of us went to the library for books. We went to the library
for computers. I was going to use one, but I exercised some self control
and moderation, and instead browsed the fiction section.</p>

<p>We also went to the library because in the parking lot there is a water
store booth thing. “¡La Mejor Agua!” One quarter buys one gallon. Bring
your own containers. Well, one quarter buys one gallon and one cup, as
my brother and I discovered. Surprisingly. When the gallon jug was full
and the water didnʼt stop.</p>

<p>Back at the house we learned why none of us would ever see a Dashboard
Confessional concert. We donʼt know the words to all the songs. We were
watching some concerts on a DVD, and if they are any indication, you are
required to know all the words to all the songs to be admitted. Maybe
the restriction only applies to the first twelve rows. Or girls. I think
you have to take a test to get in, one of those fill-in-the-blank tests
with just a song title at the top and blanks on the rest of the page.
Not my style.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kb1xjrn5c26783k/20050221-pb-cookies.jpg" alt="Peanut butter cookies" /></p>

<p>We still needed to eat dinner. For some reason I always eat fish sticks
and tater tots when I visit Waco. The aforementioned fish sticks and
tater tots were cooked and cooling when Daniel suggested we
make cookies or brownies or something. I suggested we eat first, but my
brother was afraid eating dinner first would spoil his appetite for
making cookies. We risked it. With dinner out of the way, and no
appetites spoiled, we began mixing up some deluxe peanut butter cookies.</p>

<p>First we broke the hand mixer, then we broke the <em>other</em> hand mixer, so
we had to resort to using the KitchenAid megamixer. We should have
started with that. It was so awesome. We got peanut butter all over the
counter and the wall and the side of the refridgerator. They turned out
great. The recipe said it makes 36 cookies. It didnʼt make 36 cookies,
but they sure tasted like 36 cookies.</p>

<p>At this point I had taken some photographs with my 35mm camera, and the
roll of film was full. I had an unexplainable urge to get them developed
immediately, but it was 19:30, and I couldnʼt think of anyone who did
one-hour processing at that time on a Saturday night. But a guy can try.</p>

<p>We drove to CVS first, because it was closest. My brother was going to
stay in the car while I ran in to drop off my film, but I convinced him
to come with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Youʼre going to want to see this. Iʼll probably have to flirt with
someone to get these photos developed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CVS? More like, CV No! That cute girl at the photo desk let me down.</p>

<p>Our next stop was HEB. I sprinted across the parking lot and into the
store, apparently drawing the attention of several security guards. I
ran up to the photo desk and quickly regained my composure. I asked the
man on duty if he did one-hour processing at that time, and I think he
twitched. Then he gave me a look that could be interpreted two ways:
“Are you some kind of idiot? Who would do one-hour processing at this
time of night? Certainly not me!” or “Well, are you going to say
something to me?”</p>

<p>It turns out that his twitch was actually an affirmative nod, and I
looked like an idiot because I just looked at him for fifteen seconds
before saying anything. Anyway, he took my film, said it would probably
be ready in thirty minutes, and I left. When I came back 45 minutes
later he was looking for me. He handed me my pictures and said, “What
took you so long? I said it would be done in thirty minutes!” And that,
my friends, is why HEB will always be the coolest store in the world.</p>

<p>To the mothers in the audience, I also learned that there are two ways
to get leftovers eaten: put them in a clear container so your children
can see what it is; or put them in an ice cream container.</p>
