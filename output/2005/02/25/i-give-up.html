<p>Can anyone imagine the day I give up computers completely?</p>

<p>Or, more specifically, can anyone imagine that day being any day other
than the day I die?</p>

<p>Yeah, me neither.</p>

<p>Several months ago, I was searching for some information to help me with
my site, when I came across <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">a website that helped me quite a bit</a>.
The author of this site was an accomplished programmer, and I learned a
lot from him. He gave some cool tips that I implemented on my site, and
in the process I learned more about the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">software</a> <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">that</a>
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">powers</a> Subtle Coolness.</p>

<p>Then one day in October 2004, this author <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/10/18/exit">simply wrote</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Itʼs time for me to find a new hobby. Preferably one that doesnʼt
involve angle brackets. Or computers. Or electricity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His website hasnʼt changed since. Could I ever do that? Those who know
me would probably say, “No.”</p>

<p><a href="http://homestarrunner.com/sbemail123.html">“Heck no at all.”</a></p>

<p>With that said, those who know me would probably confirm that I spend
too much time at a computer. Considering I almost always have a computer
<em>in my pocket</em>, I am inclined to agree.</p>

<p>This week I backed off. This week I <em>exercised</em>.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” you say. But yes, this week I exercised; and I exercised more
than once; and I enjoyed it. I have decided to swim every day the swim
center is open (except Sunday, of course). Unfortunately, the swim
center is closed today, so no swimming for me.</p>

<p>Swimming is awesome. You get a good workout, in your arms and your legs,
and you get out of breath, and there is always someone there to save you
if you pass out. As a bonus, youʼre not sore the next day. All that
water is doing wonders for my skin.</p>

<p>The whole locker room experience still scares me, though.</p>
