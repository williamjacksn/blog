<p>Subtle Coolness has recently taken a backseat to some other projects of
mine. Most notably, I just started a website for my family to keep in
touch more easily, and itʼs been a big hit. Just ask my siblings.</p>

<p>Also, with a recent friendly challenge to refrain from blogging for a
week, then Spring Break and its accompanying lack of Internet, the place
has felt rather deserted. That is, of course, except for all the
wonderful, marvelous, terrific friends wishing me a happy birthday. You
know who you are. You know how awesome you are.</p>

<p>I drove way more than average over Spring Break. I drove (what felt
like) halfway across the state to visit my sister and her family. I
drove all around town while I was staying with my parents. I took a late
night/early morning excursion to St. Olafʼs Lutheran church to see if it
was really haunted. It is this latter story that I wish to divulge
herein.</p>

<p>I had heard about St. Olafʼs on several occasions previously, but I
never had the chance to visit. I expressed my desire to go during Spring
Break, and after two postponements, several of my friends consented to
take me there. We were in two cars. I was following. The lead driver
speeds. We were tearing down the highway at who knows what speed, when I
saw police lights come on behind me. Hooray. I pulled over with
anticipation, but the cruiser just zipped right past me and proceeded to
pull over the lead driver.</p>

<p>That was hilarious. Thankfully, he only got a warning, and we were on
our way again. My passenger and I watched the entire show from a nearby
gas station parking lot. I then mentioned to my passenger that I had
never been pulled over before, <em>ever</em>, and I really wouldnʼt know what
to do if I ever was stopped by the police.</p>

<p>We drove for a while longer, and checked out St. Olafʼs (which required
some light trespassing—Iʼm not proud of that). I decided that the
church was old, small, well-kept, and anything but haunted. We all drove
back to town, and I dropped off my passenger and began my short drive
home.</p>

<p>In a solid residential area, I make a left turn, and out of nowhere I
have police lights flashing behind me. This time there wasnʼt anyone in
front of me to pull over. This was <em>my</em> time.</p>

<p>Apparently, I failed to use my turn signal when I took the left turn.
Silly me. I got away with nothing but the strict advice, “Obey <em>all</em> the
laws tonight.”</p>

<p>I can no longer say I have never been pulled over. But Iʼm still
ticketless, and thatʼs just awesome.</p>

<p>P.S. Thanks, Dad, for keeping me on your insurance, even if the proof of
insurance card in the car expired seven days ago.</p>
