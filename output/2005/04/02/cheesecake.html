<p>Do you remember how I dominated the tortilla world? Unfortunately, I do
not have that effect on all foods everywhere. Specifically, I have a
twisted love/hate relationship with cheesecake from The Cheesecake
Factory.</p>

<p>Today is my best friend始s birthday. Last night he celebrated wth a small
gathering of friends at The Cheesecake Factory. There were nine of us,
and when we were seated we let the server know we would only be having
dessert.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She still brought us bread and butter. That始s not a bad thing, because
the bread is <em>so</em> good, but I probably ate too much, knowing what lay
before me. When my slice of Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake came out, I
was still incredibly optimistic about the whole situation.</p>

<p>After a fair amount of bites, including a taste of my best friend始s
Godiva chocolate, I realized that polishing off my piece of cheesecake
would increase the chances of my stomach exploding violently by several
dozen percent.</p>

<p>For cheesecake, I was willing to take that chance.</p>

<p>I cleaned my plate, then slouched down in my chair, using my <em>huge</em>
napkin as a blanket of sorts (for comic relief). If I had seams, I felt
like I would burst at them any moment.</p>

<p>I really don始t mind being beaten by cheesecake every once and again.</p>

<p>In closing, happy birthday!</p>
