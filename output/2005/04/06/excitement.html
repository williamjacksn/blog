<p>Swimming gives me time to think. Today, in the pool, I was thinking about
what I needed to do later his week. I was trying to remember when my exam
for Computer Science was, so I could be prepared. I suddenly remembered that
my Computer Science exam was held last night.</p>

<p>Thatʼs right, I completely forgot about it, and rearranged the furniture in
my apartment instead.</p>

<p>As I write this I am waiting for a response from my professor regarding
whether I can take a makeup exam or not. If you hear a knocking, thatʼs the
sound of my head hitting the wall repeatedly for the next hour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock
knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock
knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock
knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock
knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock
knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock
knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock
knock knock knock knock and so forth.</p>
