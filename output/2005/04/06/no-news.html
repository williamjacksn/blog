<p>Either life just hasnʼt been exciting recently or I canʼt see it as well
as before, or Iʼm taking a break, or Iʼm all out of creativity. Letʼs
hope none of those are true, except perhaps the “taking a break” part.</p>

<p>On Monday I resolved to obey the following scripture:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with
another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed
early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and
your minds may be invigorated. (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 88:124)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iʼve been doing well with “arise early” for the last year. I wake up at
six oʼclock almost every morning. My problem has been with the “retire”
half of the verse. My usual bed time was somewhere between midnight and
two in the morning. Thatʼs not good.</p>

<p>Therefore, beginning last Monday night, I set a goal to be in my bed
with the lights out at 10:00 PM. If you are trying to get in touch with
me, thatʼs when my day ends.</p>

<p>Of course, I want to make it perfectly clear that I wonʼt ignore phone
calls that come later than 10. I wonʼt hate you forever if you wake me
up. Just understand that the phone might ring longer than you expect.</p>

<p>In unrelated news, Aaron and I rearranged the furniture in our apartment
last night. Thereʼs really nothing witty or exciting about that, but
itʼs news.</p>

<p>I should probably give a prize to the person who yawned the least while
reading this.</p>
