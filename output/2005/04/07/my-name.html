<p>Itʼs barely noon, and I have had one exciting day so far. My Computer
Science professor allowed me to take the exam this morning at 09:00, for
which I will be eternally grateful. Because we had to walk to an empty
room and get me situated, she gave me until 11:05 to finish.</p>

<p>I didnʼt answer everything, but I had to stop at 10:50 so I could go to
my 11:00 Government class and take an exam there. The Government exam
was significantly easier, and I finished it in about twenty minutes.
Unfortunately, I was boxed in on both sides and didnʼt want to disturb
the students around me, so I waited another fifteen or twenty minutes
before I left.</p>

<p>Iʼm certain only about 20% of the student in this Government class come
to the lecture every time, so I am always surprised to walk in on a test
day to see the hall filled to capacity. This is the second time someone
has taken my seat, too.</p>

<p>Wouldnʼt that just frustrate you? Here I am, I come to every class and
sit in the same seat every Tuesday and Thursday, and on test day some
lazy student who probably never comes to the lecture just moseys on in
and sits in my seat like itʼs fair game. It was probably only the fourth
time sheʼs been in that hall all semester, no doubt.</p>

<p>At least I remembered to take the test.</p>
