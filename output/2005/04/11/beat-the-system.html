<p>One week ago, on 4 April 2005, I parked my best friendʼs car outside his
dorm. I remember it like it was only last week. It was 17:45, the very
minute those particular parking spots change from permit-only to
anyone-can-park-there.</p>

<p>I began walking towards the swimming center, and I called the aforementioned
best friend to inform him concerning the whereabouts of his car. I left it
there because I would not be going to Family Home Evening with him. All was
well, the swimming was great, and the FHE that I <em>did</em> go to was fun, too.</p>

<p>Later that evening, I was waiting for my friend to come to my apartment so I
could drive him home. My phone rang. It was him.</p>

<p>“Heʼs close,” I thought. He always calls when he is close.</p>

<p>He actually called to tell me that I got a parking ticket. Unbelievable. The
violation: “Parking a motor vehicle in an unauthorized are without a valid
permit.” The time on the ticket: 17:45. Un-<em>freaking</em>-believable.</p>

<p>What parking attendant dares give me a ticket at the exact minute the area
becomes free game, and on the fourth anniversary to the day of the first
time I ever donated blood? Seriously. This ticket had disrespect smeared all
over it.</p>

<p>My best friend told me to appeal it; my roommate told me to appeal it; I
knew the whole time I was going to appeal it. I appealed it.</p>

<p>This morning I received an email from Parking &amp; Transportation Services.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After review of the information you provided in your written appeal, the
Appeals Officerʼs determination is to void the citation. Information on
how to avoid citations is available on the Parking and Transportation
Service (PTS) web site at
http://www.utexas.edu/parking/appeal/avoid/index.html.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Youʼre darned right the citation is void. Thanks for that link on how to
avoid citations, as well. I could have used that a week ago.</p>

<p>In closing, I completely beat the system, and my sister would be so proud of
me.</p>
