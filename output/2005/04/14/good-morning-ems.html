<p>I love a twist in my morning routine. After my email reading, showering,
dressing, and breakfasting, said twist arrived. Said twist arrived in the
form of a siren that came down my street and stopped right outside my
window.</p>

<p>Sadly, I didnʼt even get to see what was going on. There wasnʼt a fire
anywhere. I didnʼt see any automobile accidents. It was kind of
disappointing.</p>

<p>Just listen to me, getting disappointed because there were no disasters
outside my home this morning.</p>
