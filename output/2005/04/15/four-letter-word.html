<p>This morning I reminded myself what it feels like to turn off my alarm
and get back in bed. Then I reminded myself what it feels like to jolt
out of bed two hours later with a sick sensation in my gut. Then I
reminded myself what it feels like to call my supervisor to tell her I
would be late to work. Then I reminded myself what it feels like to rush
to work without taking a shower.</p>

<p>Resplendent; aghast; abashed; icky.</p>

<p>Today I feel icky. I didnʼt take a shower, therefore I didnʼt wash my
hair, and it looks and feels icky. I went to bed without taking off my
Livestrong bracelet, and Iʼm still wearing it. Thatʼs just icky. I wore
sandals to save time, and my feet feel icky.</p>

<p>In my dream this morning I kept a crab in my pocket.</p>

<p>Iʼm icky at work. Iʼll probably go to Friday Forum feeling icky, I
wanted to get my hair cut after that, but itʼs not clean so those plans
are out the window.</p>

<p>I hate feeling icky.</p>
