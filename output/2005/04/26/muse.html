<p>Hereʼs the transcript of part of an instant messenger conversation I just had:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>her (16:04:39)</strong>: hello william<br />
<strong>her (16:04:42)</strong>: you should come to muse<br />
<strong>her (16:04:45)</strong>: here are the reasons one<br />
<strong>her (16:04:48)</strong>: 1) they rock<br />
<strong>her (16:04:51)</strong>: 2) its cheap<br />
<strong>her (16:05:03)</strong>: 3) everyone else is going and you would find yourself laughing loudly<br />
<strong>her (16:05:13)</strong>: 4) itʼll help you get away from the graduation thing you dont want to go to..
<strong>her (16:05:26)</strong>: 5) i can flirt in a non-threatening friendship kinda way<br />
<strong>her (16:05:48)</strong>: 6) you can expierience the thrill of loud guitars and pretty piano chords and solos and singing<br />
<strong>her (16:05:51)</strong>: i think thatʼs it
<strong>me (16:06:05)</strong>: Keep taking, this is all going on Subtle Coolness.<br />
<strong>her (16:06:10)</strong>: lol<br />
<strong>her (16:06:22)</strong>: 7) you need to get in touch with you…femanine side<br />
<strong>her (16:06:46)</strong>: 8) standing on your feet for a few hours and sweating will make for a memorable car ride home with your friends</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sheʼs been bugging me about going to this concert for a while now, and I was afraid it was going to conflict with a graduation party I will be attending, but today I found out that it wonʼt. So Iʼm going. To both.</p>

<p>Sometimes, peer pressure just <em>works</em>.</p>
