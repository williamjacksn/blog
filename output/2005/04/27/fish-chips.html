<p>Yesterday was my motherʼs birthday. She turned 29 again.</p>

<p>One of my brothers was flying into town last night, so when my parents
came down to pick him up, the four of us went to dinner together.</p>

<p>We had a fun time finding the place, because we didnʼt decide where we
wanted to go until after we left the airport, and I was giving
directions. I <em>am</em> the guy who has lived in this town for several years
now. I should know my way around.</p>

<p>That would be true if I owned a car.</p>

<p>Luckily, I had been to this restaurant just last week, so I had a good
idea of which way to go. We just needed to find a road that crossed the
river.</p>

<p>There were plenty of emergency vehicles around, too, and Iʼm not sure
why.</p>

<p>My twin brother and I ordered the same thing, in unison: fish and chips.
I hadnʼt seen him since last summer. Mom got the sampler. Dad got the
salmon. Our waiter guessed it was my motherʼs birthday and brought us
free dessert.</p>

<p>After dinner we stopped at my apartment, where I gave my mother some
flowers, a card, and a finger-painting I did for her. Then my parents
and brother left for home, and I stayed up entirely too late playing
a video game.</p>
