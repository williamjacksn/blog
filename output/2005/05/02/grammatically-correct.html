<p>My friends, in this digital age where peer pressure, WPMs and Internet
trends reign supreme, you need guts to stand for grammatical correctness.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learn and use correct grammar when you type. If you must, find out about
“spell checking”. You didnʼt take English every single year of your
primary and secondary education for nothing. A person who knows how to
use the language and isnʼt afraid to do so is attractive.</li>
  <li>Read what you typed before you press “Enter”. When you donʼt, more often
than not you will really wish you did.</li>
  <li>Sentence fragments have their place. Like right here. Use them wisely.</li>
  <li>Your “Shift” key is not broken. Capitalize on that. The more you use it,
the stronger your pinky fingers will become. Think how much more your
promises will mean to others when you make them with strong pinkies.</li>
  <li>Punctuation is part of the alphabet, too. Semicolons get lonely; include
them every once in a while.</li>
</ol>

<p>I may not have a large vocabulary, but I will proudly discriminate against
the words “u”, “r”, “4” and “lol”.</p>

<p>Sometimes <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail89.html">songs</a> can help you remember grammar rules. All these songs
are taken from the album <em>Strong Badʼs Rhythm Nʼ Grammar</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want it to be possessive, itʼs just ‘ITS’. But if itʼs supposed to
be a contraction then itʼs ‘I-T-apostrophe-S’, scalawag.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What ever happened to capitalization? It used to be so cool!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Girl, donʼt forget to spell check, or Iʼll come to your house and throw a
brick through your dadʼs windshield (windshield).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Y-O-U-R’. ‘Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E’. Theyʼre as different as night and day.
Donʼt you think that night and day are different? Whatʼs wrong with you?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I donʼt care how they spell things on the Internet; When you email me,
you spell the whole word out. And I donʼt care that your cell phone has a
camera in it.</p>
