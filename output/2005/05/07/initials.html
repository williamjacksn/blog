<p>Dear S.,</p>

<p>I was particularly pleased with the first image I scanned: the one you asked about. Unfortunately, I didnʼt save it. Today I re-scanned my initials to give you the closer look you requested.</p>

<p>Honestly, I donʼt think I did as well. I only had a pencil available to me today, and the original was done in felt-tipped pen. My handwriting also changes from day to day, depending on my mood.</p>

<p>In summary, I find it strange that I feel disappointed with my own initials, but that is, indeed, how I feel.</p>

<p>I remain</p>

<p>Your loving brother,
W.</p>
