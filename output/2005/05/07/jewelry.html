<p>It almost lasted a year.</p>

<p>On 18 May 2004, I went to County Line Barbecue with Chloë and some friends. To begin the evening, she gave me this charm.</p>

<p>It was a little inside joke, really. Earlier, we were at some department store, looking at those cute purses with letters on them. I assume, for example, that if your name is “Chloë”, you would get a purse with the letter “C” on it. I realized that I hadnʼt seen any purses sporting the letter “W”, and I mentioned this to Chloë. We spent the next ten minutes scouring the shelves, but our search was fruitless.</p>

<p>I have empathy for the Wilmas, Wandas, Wendys, Whitneys, Winifreds, Wrens and Wynonas that canʼt buy a purse with their initial on it.</p>

<p>So, Chloë found this charm at <a href="http://www.claires.com/">Claireʼs</a> and gave it to me. The other girl that was going to dinner with us said, “Itʼs from Claireʼs, so it will be broken in two weeks.”</p>

<p>Three hundred fifty-four days later, the gem broke off in my pocket.</p>
