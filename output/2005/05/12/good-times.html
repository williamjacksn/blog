<p>Itʼs official: <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/buginmouth.html">the good times are over</a>.</p>

<p>I just completed my final final. I hated it. Now the semester is over.
Now all I have to look forward to is the lab and my apartment.</p>

<p>The good times will now be replaced by better times.</p>

<p>Iʼm really going to enjoy visiting my family this summer. This past
semester has been the semester of connectivity. I was in contact with
more of my siblings more often over the last five months than in the
previous two years, total. I think.</p>

<p>I have the Internet to thank for that. I love technology; but not as
much as you, you see; but I still love technology.</p>

<p>Always and forever.</p>
