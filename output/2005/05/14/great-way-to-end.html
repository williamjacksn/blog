<p>Last night I had dinner and fun with a good group of people. We ate
burritos, and you all know <a href="/2005/03/22/monster">how much I love tortillas</a>. Before dinner,
though, we were chatting, getting to know each other, and generally having
an amusing conversation.</p>

<p>We discussed Cookie Monster, and how he needs a new name, now that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4432415.stm">he
doesnʼt exclusively eat cookies anymore</a>.</p>

<p>“Weʼll call him Harold,” I said, “because Grover is already taken.”</p>

<p>“By who?” the girl across the room asked. I couldnʼt believe my ears.</p>

<p>“By Grover,” I replied, with all seriousness. I think I might have been
slightly glaring when I said that, considering the look she gave me, but it
was absolutely hilarious.</p>

<p>After dinner we began preparations for “the festivities”. We were filling
little balloons with powdered dye, then adding water, to make paint-water
bombs. We also mixed up a few gallons of pudding.</p>

<p>One girl – coincidently, the same one from the Grover episode – was
particularly good at getting the powder in the balloons. She mentioned that
she grew up in Argentina, and I put two and two together. As a baby she was
kidnapped by a South American drug lord, and all her life she smuggled
cocaine by stuffing balloons then swallowing them.</p>

<p>She did slip into a suspicious Hispanic accent from time to time.</p>

<p>When the balloons were ready, we rolled out a bunch of butcher paper and
painted on it with pudding with our feet. Of course, that got a bit out of
hand, and a significant amount of pudding ended up on bodies instead of
paper.</p>

<p>Finally, the balloons came out. This was a standard water balloon battle,
augmented by the fact that all our clothes were permanently dyed red and
green at the end.</p>

<p>Luckily, there was a swimming pool at the apartment complex we were using as
our battlefield, so most of us jumped in to wash ourselves off. I canʼt
remember the last time I jumped in a swimming pool with all my clothes on.</p>

<p>When everything settled down, we spent the rest of the evening determining
what color each otherʼs mind was, and reading Chinese silverware writing.</p>

<p>The whole night was totally awesome.</p>
