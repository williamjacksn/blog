<p>I saw <em>Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</em> Thursday night, but I
canʼt make any comments until I know everyone has seen it already. I
donʼt want to spoil anything for you.</p>

<p>What with school being out, I have been doing a lot of sitting around
recently. For the record, I completed <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em> on the
GameCube. I wasted almost 24 hours of my life on that game. Way to go,
William.</p>

<p>Continuing in the video game department, Iʼve been halfway through
<em>Final Fantasy VII</em> for about six months now. I havenʼt touch the game
in that time. I just got bored with it.</p>

<p>A friend just let me borrow <em>Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force</em>, and I
started on it this morning. Itʼs a first-person shooter, just like
<em>Doom</em> or <em>Goldeneye</em> or <em>Metroid Prime</em>. As such, itʼs already quite
repetitive: point, shoot, point, shoot, strafe, shoot, shoot, crouch,
out of ammo, change weapon, point, shoot. You get the idea.</p>

<p>My ultimate summer plans are not solid yet, but I will report on them as
soon as I know myself what they will be.</p>
