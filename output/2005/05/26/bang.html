<p>Today was indeed my last day of work at the lab. I came in to do a mentoring
demonstration for one of my supervisors. When I was done with that I made my
way to the Human Resources department, stepped in the door, and loudly said,
“I need to be terminated.”</p>

<p>That got a chuckle from the woman at the desk. She even shot me with her
finger.</p>

<p>Another proctor was filling out her “separation paperwork” at the same time.
“Separation paperwork” makes it sound like Iʼm divorcing the computer lab. I
would never dream of such a thing.</p>

<p>Today the Information Technology Services department was also having a
barbecue on campus. My recently terminated friend and I went to get a free
lunch – in your face, <em>tinstaafl</em>. When we got there the party was in full
swing, and all the brisket was gone. We were told some more meat was on the
way, so we waited.</p>

<p>We waited a long time. Finally, I broke down and got a plateful of potato
salad, chips and cookies. At the very moment when I was ready to sink into
despair and abandon myself to destruction – not to an imaginary ruin, but
to the power of my actual stomach – just at this moment of great alarm, the
meat arrived.</p>

<p>Oh, it was good.</p>

<p>As we were leaving the barbecue, my recently terminated friend yelled, “Hey,
whereʼs your purse!” Indeed, I had left my European carry-all under the
table at which I was seated. She saved the day!</p>
