<p>What with school being over, and my employment terminated, I have been
wasting time watching movies. These are the films I have watched in the
last five days:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/"><em>Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</em></a><br />
Iʼve already seen it twice. It is so much better than Episodes I and
II. Itʼs hard for me to decide who is more evil: Palpatine or
Anakin.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108265/"><em>Swing Kids</em></a><br />
Iʼve seen this one before, but it was a while ago so I wanted to
remind myself. Itʼs sad, like most World War II films are, but the
music is really good.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/"><em>Monsters, Inc.</em></a><br />
I finally got to watch it. I loved it. I actually found it very
touching, the way Sully and Boo form their relationship. I just
about cried on the last scene when Sully goes through the door, and
we hear Booʼs voice.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</em></a><br />
I remember watching this bad boy in the theatre on opening night.
This time I watched the extended version. Itʼs four hours long! That
was the most surprising part about it. All the goodbyes at the end
make me sad.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183790/"><em>A Knightʼs Tale</em></a>
There were a few good lines in this movie. Paul Bettany was funny,
but did he have to be naked so much?</li>
</ul>

<p>Iʼll probably watch more tomorrow. I should go to the gym again.</p>

<p>At least I had a great conversation with a good friend today. Or was it
a <em>good</em> conversation with a <em>great</em> friend? Oh yes, it was a <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/tgs4.html">grood</a>
conversation with a <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/tgs4.html">grood</a> friend. We talked about religion and
relationships and coffee, among other things. Yep, coffee is still bad
for you.</p>
