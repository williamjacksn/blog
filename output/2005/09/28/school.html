<p>I want to write a poem, <em>right now</em>, but it never really works that way.</p>

<p>What has become of me? If I recall correctly, in the last two weeks,
almost every time I have held a conversation longer than two minutes
with someone I have said, “I hate school.” <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/sbemail134.html">What a bunch of bull
honkey.</a></p>

<p>School is totally awesome, for the following reasons, which have been
conveniently numbered so you donʼt have to count them yourself.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I only “go to school” two days of the week.</li>
  <li>Every morning that I go to school, I get to ride on a bus full of
students and other people. With few exceptions, I will be standing
on said bus, and said students and other people quite possible
number in the low hundreds.</li>
  <li>I get to walk around in the 107 degree heat. How many states in the
United States can boast that sort of temperaturage? Few, if any.
Thatʼs why the Austin TX has way better Blue Book value than <a href="http://www.onlineutah.com/austin.shtml">the
standard Austin</a>. And whatʼs with the “Population: ?”?</li>
  <li>I sit on the second row in all my classes because I am “ambitious,
but not overbearing.” And looking at the PowerPoint presentations
from the first row makes my neck hurt.</li>
  <li>“Mice come in two varieties. One kind has a little ball inside, and
the other kind has a little light inside.” -Alan Lee, professor,
Computer Systems Architecture</li>
</ol>

<p>So, as I have clearly demonstrated using my incredible powers of
enumeration, school is, indeed, totally awesome. I have given six
perfectly sound reasons for coming to such a conclusion. So if any of
you ever hear me say, “I hate school,” again, please correct me.</p>
