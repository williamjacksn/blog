<p>Saturday, 15 October was the Halloween Dance at the LDS Institute. It
felt a little early in the month for costumes, but I couldnʼt resist. I
dressed up as my hero, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>

<p>This year I was more specific than I have ever been. I was Obi-Wan
Kenobi as played by Ewan McGregor in <em>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</em>.
I started growing a beard three weeks in advance. I studied countless
pictures so I could part my hair in the right place.</p>

<p>All my preparation paid off. I won the prize for “most authentic
costume” at the dance. I was freaking elated. And I got a Snickers.</p>

<p>The best part is that I get to do it again on the 31st.</p>
