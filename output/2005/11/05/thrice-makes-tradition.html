<p>This evening marks the third time I have had the privilege of listening to
<a href="http://www.deathcabforcutie.com/">Death Cab for Cutie</a> play live at <a href="http://www.stubbsaustin.com/">Stubbʼs</a>.</p>

<p>The first instance fell on 28 April 2004. I didnʼt go to the concert, but
Chloë called me from the concert and I heard Death Cab live for the first
time over a cell phone.</p>

<p>The second chance I had to hear, nay, <em>experience</em> this fine band, was 30
October 2004. This time I was at the concert in person. Chloë was there,
too. <a href="/2004/11/03/under-21">It was incredible</a>.</p>

<p>Death Cab concert number three came tonight. I wasnʼt even expecting it. I
knew they were playing, I knew some of my friends would be there, but I just
wasnʼt in the mood to fork out the dough this year. I was playing <em><a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swrepubliccommando/hud.html">Star
Wars: Republic Commando</a></em> when I answered my phone and heard a familiar
band playing on the other end.</p>

<p>It was so cool to hear Death Cab live again, even if the sound quality
sucked. I also felt some unidentifiable emotion – a strange sort of
disappointment, as far as I could tell – because it wasnʼt Chloë calling me
from the concert. It was Christine, and sheʼs every bit as cool, but me and
Death Cab for Cutie and Stubbʼs and Chloë have a history.</p>

<p>And somehow that makes a difference.</p>
