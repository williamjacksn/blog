            <h2>The Life Science Library</h2>
<p class="small"><a href="/2005/11/18/life-science-library">&para;</a> 2005-11-18 10:33:00 +0000</p>
<p>Iʼve heard that there are over 50,000 students enrolled at my school, the
University of Texas, and Iʼve often wondered where everyone is. Iʼve decided
I want to find out.</p>

<p>Armed with a robust iBook that I checked out from the Flawn Academic Center,
Iʼm going to try to visit some lesser-known places on the campus and
describe what I find. Today Iʼm in the <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/lsl/">Life Science Library</a>.</p>

<p>This library is everything a library should be, and probably has been for
longer than I have been alive. Iʼm in the “Reading Room”, a long rectangular
room with lots of windows providing natural light. All around the walls,
where there arenʼt windows, there are shelves full of books and periodicals.
There are several big wooden tables with big, uncomfortable wooden chairs.
There are even several standing-height desks with ominous-looking
dictionaries on them.</p>

<p>I just walked over to check: Weʼve got <em>Websterʼs Third New International
Dictionary (Unabridged)</em> open to “chiffer - china aster”. Thereʼs a cute
black-and-white drawing of a chimpanzee in one of the columns.</p>

<p>Another volume of the same edition is open to “hanker - hard”. The only
picture on the entire page is a hansom–the kind that Sherlock Holmes used
to ride around in.</p>

<p>Also on this desk are three large atlases. They are open to Australia, Japan
and Canada. One of them was printed in 1986.</p>

<p>I was sitting near the “new periodicals” shelf a few minutes ago when
suddenly, three people came out of nowhere and started to stack up all the
magazines and take them away. Then another man rolled a book cart over and
filled the empty shelves with <em>new</em> new periodicals. I suppose this happens
every week. I should probably feel awed that I was here when it actually
happened.</p>

<p>In the entry hall of the library, near the circulation and information desk,
are several glass cases displaying various copies of <em>Don Quixote</em>. There
are forty copies total, all in different languages or from different time
periods. Apparently, we have quite the collection of rare copies of <em>Don
Quixote</em>.</p>

<p>Next come the stacks. The ceiling is only about seven feet tall. The space
between the shelves: three feet at the most. Browse through back issues of
<em>Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology</em>. Go up a level to find your
favorite issue of <em>Protein Engineering</em>. Go down a level and crack open the
<em>American Journal of Physiology</em> Vol. 1 Num. 1 (January 3, 1898). The very
first article is entitled “Influence of Borax and Boric Acid upon Nutrition
with Special Reference to Proteid Metabolism”. That sounds like a real
page-turner.</p>

<p>Back in the Reading Room, I forgot to mention the quotes painted on the
ceilingʼs support beams. Hereʼs one of my favorites, in modern English:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O would some power the gift give us<br />
To see ourselves as others see us!<br />
It would from many a blunder free us<br />
And foolish notion. [Robert Burns]</p>
</blockquote>
