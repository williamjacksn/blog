<p>I like libraries. A week and a half ago I explored the Life Science
Library and subconsciously decided that the Universityʼs libraries are
the Universityʼs coolest places. Hold on tight while I elaborate on
this thought.</p>

<p>Welcome to the <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/apl/">Architecture and Planning Library</a>. What exactly is
being planned here I have yet to discover. Doubtless my capable iBook
and I will uncover this mystery.</p>

<p>Here I am in the Reading Room, <a href="/2005/11/18/life-science-library">as before</a>. Iʼm quickly concluding
that every good library needs a room specifically designated for
reading. Otherwise, there probably wouldnʼt be much reading being done
at all.</p>

<p>The ceiling must be at least thirty feet above the floor, and itʼs
peaked, so there are rafters (like in some ancient kingʼs hall). There
are many long desks with sturdy-backed chairs, and lamps. All the lamps
are on because itʼs evening. A dozen chandeliers hang from the lofty
ceiling as well. Iʼm sure during the day the light coming through all
these windows would be gorgeous. Iʼll have to come back another time.</p>

<p>Iʼm sitting on a leather couch, facing another leather couch, with
comfortable-looking armchairs on either side. All this furniture in the
immediate vicinity is surrounding a flowery rug. On the rug, in the
center, is a piece of furniture thatʼs too short and too narrow to be a
table, while at the same time too wide to be a bench. The only obvious
conclusion is obviously happy: itʼs a footrest! I know some other
libraries that could use a good footrest.</p>

<p>Hereʼs a moderately sized model of a Mayan temple, encased in glass.
This is an architecture library after all. I also might as well make a
habit of telling you what page the big dictionary is turned to:
malleolable - man. Iʼll spare you the contents of the stacks today.</p>

<p>In proper story-telling manner, Iʼve saved the best for last. As I sit
on my comfortable couch with my feet propped up to just the right height
on this welcome footrest, I need but merely turn my head a little to the
left to gaze upon the libraryʼs Christmas tree. She must be seven feet
tall, and all surrounded with red, green and white pearls, like a 1920s
jazz club. Full of multicolored lights and candy canes, I am reminded of
home. We used to lay on our backs near the tree, and as the randomly
flashing lights painted the ceiling in unpredictable patterns, we
make-believed we were shooting through hyperspace on our way to
who-knows-where.</p>

<p>I like libraries, but I <em>love</em> Christmas.</p>
