<p>I had originally planned to go to the <a href="http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/tol/default.htm">Trail of Lights</a> with my ward
tonight, but Michael Perrone called and
offered me a ticket to John Longhurstʼs holiday organ concert. I decided
that if I had seen the Trail of Lights once I had seen it a million
times, and I could very well get some friends together and walk around
in the cold and the dark for forty-five minutes any other day this
month. So I went to the concert, with Michael and Theresa Jordan and Mariah Campbell.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mormontabernaclechoir.org/info/person?person_id=18">John Longhurst</a> is a cool guy. He basically owns the organ in the
Tabernacle at Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah. Yeah, heʼs really
good. My favorite part was when he played <em>Angels We Have Heard on High</em>
and everyone in the hall (except the people sitting next to us) sang
along. We also sang <em>Silent Night</em> with a harp and some percussion later
in the concert.</p>
