  <p>par·a·noi·a: wearing a belt and suspenders simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have some cool suspenders that I will be wearing to church today. I used to only wear them under my shirts to keep too-big pants from falling off me. Then I performed in <a href="http://gilbertsullivan.org/">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>ʼs <em>Trial by Jury</em>. Suspenders and a bow tie were part of my costume.</p>

<p>I decided the suspenders could be incorporated into my civilian wardrobe. Iʼm still not sure about wearing a bow tie to church, even though I have seen other people do it. Well, Iʼve seen <em>one</em> other person do it.</p>
