<p>Mr. Santa Claus<br />
North Pole<br />
Canada</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Claus,</p>

<p>I hope you receive this letter. Youʼre not the type of guy thatʼs easy
to get in touch with. Iʼm still not sure if you fall in the jurisdiction
of Canada, but Iʼm sure the postal service there will oblige me by
delivering this letter.</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that, due to the increasing world population, you
havenʼt been able to keep track of the naughty/nice status of several
people in my area. Just in case I am one of them, I wanted to make sure
you got all the details.</p>

<p>I should begin my pointing out how good I have been recently in eating
my vegetables. Iʼve got a bag of broccoli in the freezer that I have
been working on, and I always get lettuce on my hamburgers at Wendyʼs.
Mom would be proud of me. I hope you are, too.</p>

<p>This year was incredible when it comes to not beating up on my siblings.
Thatʼs got to count for something. I even said some nice things to them
on their birthdays, if I remembered them.</p>

<p>I always paid my phone bill on time, and I was never behind on my rent.
Thatʼs pretty good for a poor college student, donʼt you think? I even
attended most of my lectures, especially the 8:00am ones. Iʼm not going
to lie to you: that was tough. I think I deserve some bonus points for
that.</p>

<p>If my current nice levels donʼt quite cover the lists I sent you in
February, May and November, would you consider an advance on all the
good things Iʼm going to do next year?</p>

<p>Hoping you bring a little snow with you this time,<br />
William</p>
