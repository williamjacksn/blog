<p>My sister Mary is a genius. I want a digital camera for my birthday, so
if you <em>must</em> get me something, send money. It was her idea. Please
note: If I owned a real digital camera, this entry would have pictures
in it.</p>

<p>I just had a <em>wonderful</em> weekend. My brother Eric came down to pick me
up from Austin late Friday afternoon, and we drove to Houston. We got to
my other brotherʼs (Davidʼs) house around 21:30. Eric and I played about
a dozen games of Crazy Eights, but I never won. We played one game of
Rummikub, and I won. I guess Crazy Eights just isnʼt my game.</p>

<p>David and his wife Chelsea werenʼt home when we went to sleep (we used
the hidden key to get in), and they were asleep when we left in the
morning. That was kind of funny.</p>

<p>Saturday morning Eric and I left Davidʼs apartment at 07:45 to pick up
my friend Cherry.</p>

<p>Background story: I met Cherry in England. We were both missionaries,
and we lived near each other for about three months, in Plymouth. That
was about three years ago. Weʼve been in touch, and when she told me she
was coming to Texas for the first time, I did my best to plan to see
her. My plan worked.</p>

<p>Cherry, Eric and I got lost on the way to <a href="http://lds.org/temples/main/0,11204,1912-1-132-2,00.html">the temple</a>. A golf course
and a three-way stop got in the way, but we got there just in time. The
temple was fabulous, as always. It was the first time Iʼve done an
endowment session in that particular temple. All the other times I went
I did baptisms.</p>

<p>After the temple the three of us ate lunch at <a href="http://www.pappadeaux.com/index.html">Pappadeaux</a> because
Cherry wanted to try alligator. It was good.</p>

<p>Back at Davidʼs apartment, we decided what to do next. We drove down to
the Gulf of Mexico, to a place called <a href="http://www.kemahboardwalk.com/">Kemah</a>. First of all, seeing
the Gulf again was awesome. Thereʼs just something about looking to the
horizon and seeing nothing but water that makes me feel … adventurous.</p>

<p>Second of all, we fed stingrays. It was weird! You have to try it. In
short, the ray swam over my entire arm and sucked a fish out of my hand.
Two words: Cool.</p>

<p>Also, if you want use one of those public telescopes that are found on
boardwalks and the tops of Empire State Buildings all over America, look
through it before you put money in it. It probably already works! Mine
did, at least.</p>

<p>After all this fun and more, we went back to Davidʼs apartment, ate a
delicious double-decker taco dinner, played a few more card games, and
dropped Cherry back where she was staying.</p>

<p>Eric and I drove back to Austin Saturday night, and Eric left for Waco
Sunday morning.</p>

<p>If Cherry didnʼt go to school 1521.1 miles (as the car drives) from
where I do, Iʼd love to do it again sometime.</p>
