<blockquote>
  <p>The nose is the only organ of the body that for the most part does not
have a self-cleaning mechanism. The purpose of the mucous is believed
to be (among other things) the entrapment of bacteria and other
undesirables that would otherwise have entered the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>By picking, we provide the nasal passages with a method of cleaning to
provide new mucous and by – ugh – eating we introduce the bacteria
into our systems that were otherwise trapped, thus allowing our immune
systems to learn about it and, more importantly, learn to defeat it.
