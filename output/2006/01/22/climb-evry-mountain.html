<p>Last Friday night I went to a birthday party for my friend Rebecca. It
was a <em>Sound of Music</em> sing-along. Just as the Reverend Mother was about
to bust out with “climb evʼry mountain,” someone made the comment that
she is really wise, like Yoda.</p>

<p>So I start singing “climb evʼry mountain” in my best Yoda voice. <em>That</em>
was funny.</p>

<p>This evening I found myself in conversation with the same Rebecca. We
both discovered that the other was an avid viewer of the television show
<em>Square One</em>. I was laughing my head off as she would describe an
episode to me, and I would know exactly what she was talking about.</p>

<p>Then I found out she has Bloomsbury copies of all the <em>Harry Potter</em>
books. That just seals the deal. One day Iʼm going to own the <em>Harry
Potter</em> book set, and Iʼm going to own the ones that were published in
England.</p>

<p>I feel so much cooler about my nerdiness now.</p>

<p>[Edit: Posted exactly at midnight. How cool is that?]</p>
