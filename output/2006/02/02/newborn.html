<blockquote>
  <p>Look at his precious face. Doesnʼt he look just like a real baby? Go ahead and pick him up. Fully as large as a newborn, and artfully jointed to sleep blissfully or snuggle in your arms, “William” captures forever that magical day your own boy came into the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
