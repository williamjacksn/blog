<p>It is incredible that a feature or an expression on a passer-byʼs face
can unlock a flood of memory and feeling.</p>

<p>When I catch a glimpse, a shadow of someone I recognize, I slow down or
stop. I look at their eyes, anticipating, hoping they will look my way.
Ninety-nine times out of one hundred our eyes never meet. And when they
do, ninety-nine times out of one hundred the image of a former friend
has already fled from that strangerʼs face. Then there follows a feeling
of disappointment, a feeling that I have been betrayed by a trick of the
light, but the tender memories and reflections evoked often make that
disappointment worth it.</p>

<p>But there arises an amazing feeling when I encounter one to whom I have
not spoken for years, yet whose name I recall just as clearly as if I
had called it out every day of my life.</p>

<p>Just as clearly as I called it out from the top of the steps of the
Flawn Academic Center earlier today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A beaming smile, a sweet embrace,<br />
“I canʼt believe it, how <em>are</em> you?
We have some catching up to do.”<br />
This was no simple strangerʼs face.</p>
