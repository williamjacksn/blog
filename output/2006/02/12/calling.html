<p class="small"><a href="/2006/02/12/calling">&para;</a> 2006-02-12 15:06:00 +0000</p>
<p>If youʼre Mormon, you know what a calling is. And you know what a second
counselor in the elders quorum presidency is. So you donʼt have to read
any more of this.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://mormon.org/">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, all the local
leaders are selected from the congregation and are not paid for their
service. When I am asked to shoulder a specific responsibility, I
receive a <em>calling</em>. Today I was <em>called</em> to be the second counselor in
the elders quorum presidency.</p>

<p>The elders quorum is a group of men in my congregation who all hold the
priesthood. The quorum is presided over by one man, who in turn has two
counselors that help him with his duties. The president and his two
counselors make up the quorum presidency. And Iʼm the second counselor.</p>

<p>The quorum presidency is responsible for teaching the members of the
quorum their priesthood duties and for giving them opportunities to
learn as they perform those duties.</p>

<p>This is going to be exciting.</p>
