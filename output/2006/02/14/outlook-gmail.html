            <h2>Putting Outlook Email Messages in Gmail</h2>
<p class="small"><a href="/2006/02/14/outlook-gmail">&para;</a> 2006-02-14 16:25:00 +0000</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/about.html">Gmail</a>. I like the idea of never throwing away email
messages. But before I had Gmail, I was already hoarding email. Iʼve
been keeping my messages in archives since 2001.</p>

<p>Ideally, I wanted to get these messages into Gmail so I could search for
them just like all my other messages. This is how I did it.</p>

<p><strong>These are the steps I took to get <em>email messages only</em> from Microsoft
Outlook <code class="highlighter-rouge">.pst</code> files into Gmail.</strong></p>

<p>Hereʼs what you need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Microsoft Outlook. Iʼve been using Outlook for years, so all my
email was stored in Microsoftʼs <code class="highlighter-rouge">.pst</code> format. It works really well
for offline storage, as long as you have a copy of Outlook to read
the files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>. If you are not aware, Thunderbird is an email
client like Microsoft Outlook, but it stores email in a different
format. It uses something called <code class="highlighter-rouge">mbox</code> format, which is a standard
across most email programs (except Microsoftʼs of course). The
latest version of Thunderbird can import messages from Outlook.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/download.htm">Mark Lyonʼs Google GMail Loader</a>. GML is the program that
actually transfers the email messages from your computer to Gmail.
It doesnʼt understand <code class="highlighter-rouge">.pst</code> files (yet), so thatʼs why we need
Thunderbird: to get the messages into <code class="highlighter-rouge">mbox</code> format.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Hereʼs what you do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure Outlook is installed correctly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For simplicity, move all your messages into the Inbox or Sent Items
of your Personal Folders. If you messages are in an external .<code class="highlighter-rouge">pst</code>
file, open it using File &gt; Open &gt; Outlook Data File…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exit Outlook. Install Thunderbird.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you run Thunderbird for the first time, it will ask you about
importing stuff from other programs. Choose Outlook from the list
and click Next. If you had a lot of messages, this will take a
while. Click Finish when you get the chance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check the folders in Thunderbird to make sure your messages really
made it in. Exit Thunderbird. Youʼre almost done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download, extract and run the GMail Loader program (gmlw.exe). Click
the Find button and go digging for Thunderbirdʼs mail files. The
default location is:</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles\Mail\Local Folders\</code></p>

    <p>For each folder in Thunderbird, there
are two files in that directory. One ends in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.msf</code>, and the other
doesnʼt have an extension. Select the one without the extension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In GML, set the File Type to “mBox (Less Strict - Solves Some
Problems)”. Set the message type according to your preference. If
you are uploading files that you sent, choose, obviously, “Mail I
Sent (Goes to Sent Mail)”. If itʼs mail from other people to you,
pick the other option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter your Gmail address and click “Send To GMail”. Then wait.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When the messages show up in your Gmail inbox, they wonʼt be threaded
properly, but they will be there and searchable. And with Gmail, thatʼs
what really counts.</p>
