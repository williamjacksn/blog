<p>Oh my crap! I got to be on the show! Anna wasnʼt there so I was the
“guest co-host” with Colleen. We talked about prophets and why they are
so cool. I was a little nervous going in but it was cool in the end.</p>

<p>This weekʼs featured artist was <a href="http://www.shawnpittman.com/">Shawn Pittman</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my bright idea didnʼt work and I didnʼt get a recording
this week. I think I have it figured out now.</p>
