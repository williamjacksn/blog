<p>The party has begun. Are you ready for the best spring break ever? I
hope so, because it is already upon us.</p>

<p>As all good spring breaks do, this yearʼs spring break started with some
yard work. I assisted my mother and two youngest brothers this morning.
I found an excuse to dig a hole in our front yard; thatʼs the point of
yard work, right? Itʼs an excuse to dig holes. We all took turns with
the shovel.</p>

<p>There was also some trimming and raking and sweeping, but you understand
none of this is as exciting as digging, for reasons unbeknownst to even
myself.</p>

<p>After all that semi-hard work, we had a picnic lunch – in the food
court of a local mall. Hey, it was cold outside. After lunch we went to
a park and tried to fly a kite and tried to play tennis.</p>
