<p>Todayʼs round of yard work was particularly nice. I used the edger –
some call it a “weed-whacker”, but that sounds uncivilized – to fight
back the advancing grass on one side of the driveway. I was telling Mom
about how I thought this activity matched my personality well. There is
a nice straight line at the edge of the concrete, and the grass must
stay off the line. The boundaries are distinctly drawn. I like that.</p>

<p>After work, Mom got to go give some meaningful service somewhere, so I
was in charge of taking my younger brothers to the cinema. First, I
underestimated the popularity of the dollar-theater during spring break.
Second, I underestimated the running time of <em>Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire</em>.</p>

<p>The line for tickets was long. Matthew wanted to watch <em>Chicken Little</em>.
Mark didnʼt. Mark watched <em>Harry Potter</em> while Matthew and I watched
<em>Chicken Little</em>. When our film was over (including all the credits), I
poked my head into Markʼs theater just in time to see the four Triwizard
champions barely starting on the second task.</p>

<p>There was no way Markʼs fifty cents was going to buy him more screen
time than me, so I watched the rest of <em>Potter</em>, too. Good film, that.</p>

<p>And then there was video games.</p>
