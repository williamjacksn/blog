<p>Mom got to once again perform some meaningful service elsewhere, but
this time it was in the morning, so I was left in charge of my two
shorter brothers during the yard work. IÊ¼m such a lenient taskmaster,
though, and Matthew and Mark were incredibly helpful. We finished all
the work we needed to do today before Dad left for work.</p>

<p>When Mom got back she decided that we needed to clean the garage. That
was a great idea. We moved some things around and got rid of some trash,
and cleaned up so much we were able to fit a car in.</p>

<p>Only someone who has lived at my house can really appreciate the fact
that we actually put a car inside our garage. That happens maybe once
every five years. Maybe.</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>, the garage door closes with the car inside.</p>
