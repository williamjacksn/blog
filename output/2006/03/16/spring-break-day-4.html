<p>You始ll never guess what I did today. I dug holes again.</p>

<p>Mom went to the temple in Dallas today. She left before I was out of
bed. The yard work challenge of the day was to remove a tree from the
back yard and replant it in the front yard.</p>

<p>The first hole Matthew, Mark and I dug was the original tree position.
It wasn始t a very big tree, but we had to dig around roots, and that made
it difficult.</p>

<p>Hole number 2 was the first candidate for the new location of the tree.
Unfortunately, I uncovered a sprinkler pipe. Lucky me. Hole 3 was two
feet away from hole 2, and it was the final resting place of the tree.</p>

<p>All the dirt (and tree) that used to be in hole 1 is now in hole 3. All
of hole 3始s original dirt is in hole 1. Let始s just pretend hole 2 never
existed.</p>

<p>Then we three [hole-digging] kings went to the bowling alley. We are all
bowling wizards: Mark scored 92, Matthew scored 136 (by cleverly bowling
three balls per frame), and I scored 174 with four strikes in a row.</p>
