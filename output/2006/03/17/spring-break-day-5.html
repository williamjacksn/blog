<p>The last day of spring break proper included a road trip and a birthday.</p>

<p>This morning Dad, Mark, Matthew and I departed in my dadʼs Buick Le
Sabre to drive to Commerce, Texas. (“Le Sabre” is french for “the
sabre”.) Itʼs a three-hour drive.</p>

<p>Thank you Mary for talking to me about life and stuff. Dad had the radio
turned down special so we could have our conversation.</p>

<p>Once we got to Commerce we rolled over to the Texas A&amp;M campus and did
some climbing on their spectacular climbing thingy. Itʼs not made of
rock, and itʼs not really a wall. Itʼs an artificial column of climbing
fury. Whatever it is, it is cool.</p>

<p>Thank you Lorraine and Chloë for singing to my voicemail. I was on the
climbing wall and didnʼt hear my phone ringing.</p>

<p>Then back at my sister Heatherʼs house we watched <em>Just Like Heaven</em>,
which was a good movie. But then I needed some fresh air and light, so
I slipped outside for a bit while dinner was cooking.</p>

<p>Oh, what a dinner! We had super-tasty lasagna. That pasta could have won
a prize, or a medal. The salad and bread were also delicious. Then out
comes an incredible cake covered with coconut and twenty-four on-fire
candles. Cake was eaten with my new favorite ice cream: English Toffee
from Braumʼs. Itʼs authentic French ice cream! Somehow.</p>

<p>My family gave me the stars for my birthday. We went to the planetarium
and I felt like I was in fourth grade again. I want to go back, it was
so fun. I might even be able to find the North Star on my own now, so
that dream of sailing the ocean is one step closer to reality.</p>

<p>Thank you Eric for your message. I was in the planetarium and my phone
was off. Thank you Sarah, Rebecca and Eric for singing to me live. It
was tender.</p>
