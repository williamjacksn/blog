<p>I check my spelling. I look up words. I like dictionaries. Here, have some knowledge:</p>

<p>A tree can be fluorescent, and it can be florescent, and it can be both.</p>

<p>You see, I was spell-checking an email in which I had typed the word “flourescent”. Looking at that word now, one can plainly see how it might have won the <em>Ugliest Word, Ever</em> award.</p>

<p>But I didnʼt realize that when I typed it, so it was misspelt. When I checked the spelling, the ever-diligent spell-checker brought this silly excuse for a word to my attention, and offered a few suggestions.</p>

<p>Two of the suggestions were “fluorescent”, what I thought I wanted to type, and “florescent”, a word I had never seen before. Except in the email to which I was replying. So, maintaining my inquisitive schoolboy charm, I looked up “florescent” and learned a new word.</p>

<p>As a bonus, I discovered that both words fit perfectly well into the sentence I was trying to construct. Or repair, at this point. So I used them both.</p>

<p>Thereʼs no sense discriminating when it comes to those lovely, lovely words.</p>
