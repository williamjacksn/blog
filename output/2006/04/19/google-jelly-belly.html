<p>Every time I put a <a href="http://jellybelly.com/Cultures/en-US/">Jelly Belly</a> Bean in my mouth, I pause. How can
the flavour of popcorn, or cantaloupe, or jalapeno, or strawberry
cheesecake be squeezed into such a little bean? And how can the flavours
be so accurate? Every bean is so wonderful. And colorful.</p>

<p>Googleʼs web applications are like that. They are colorful. But they
also cause me to sit back and reflect on how extremely cool, intuitive
and powerful they are.</p>

<p>For the last month or so, I have been looking around for a solution to
a problem. The problem: find a web-based calendar. Thatʼs easy to use.
That can do recurring appointments. That looks cool. A tall order, I
know.</p>

<p>I tried a few on my own server, and settled on one, but I wasnʼt really
satisfied. Then Google comes to the rescue.</p>

<p>I am now a very happy user of <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">Google Calendar</a>. Itʼs beautiful and
powerful and just what I needed, and every time I use it I am reminded
of Jelly Belly Beans.</p>

<p>Thatʼs the best kind of web application.</p>
