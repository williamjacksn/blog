<p>Although I didnʼt know it, in the summer of 1999 I began writing for
this website. I had set up my very first email address not long before
then, and I was a bored high school student between semesters. I thought
Dave Barry had the best job in the world: write something funny once a
week. So I invented a weekly column called <em>Turtleʼs Thoughts</em> and
emailed funny little essays I wrote to most of my extended family – the
ones with email addresses, anyway.</p>

<p>As part of the joke, I included a mock “legal disclaimer” at the end of
each email. I would change and add to the disclaimer each week. For
example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any person wishing to reproduce this article must have a dang good
reason and must say, “Pretty please with a cherry on top!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a few weeks, I began to employ inappropriate comments and insults
in the name of humor. I didnʼt think much before I wrote and I didnʼt
understand what good humor was. Thankfully, a kind reader stepped in and
taught me some things about appropriate humor, writing, life and myself.</p>

<p>My grandfather wrote me, and without criticism showed me where I had
gone wrong. He suggested that instead of shunning responsibility with a
legal disclaimer, I make my motivations clear with a mission statement.</p>

<p>My grandfather was a man that always lived with a purpose. In everything
he did he worked towards a worthy goal. He raised an amazing, loving
family; researched lifetimes worth of genealogy; saved countless lives
in the service of his country; and had the time to teach an important
lesson to me, one of his 43 grandchildren.</p>
