<blockquote>
  <p>I, having been appointed a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter, so help me God.</p>

<p>Today my best friend was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. He invited me to the ceremony. It was really cool. His father, a retired Air Force Major, commissioned him.</p>

<p>That got me to thinking. If I had done ROTC and been commissioned today, could my father have commissioned me?</p>

<p>I always feel something stirring within me when I listen to the National Anthem with my hand over my heart, facing the flag.</p>
