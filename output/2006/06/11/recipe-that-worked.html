<p>A week ago I was invited to a dinner with the Relief Society presidency and the Elders Quorum presidency of my ward. It was to occur today and it was to be pot-luck – which, as an aside, is a very interesting word when looked up in the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I had a week to decide on and prepare something to bring with me to the pot-luck dinner of presidencies. I opened my trusty <em>Jackson Family Cookbook</em> and spied the recipe for “Impossible Pie (Crustless Quiche)”. I was certain this was to be my dish.</p>

<p>As the moment of truth approached, I surveyed my cupboards, and listed the ingredients I lacked. I walked to the grocery store and purchased, among other things, bacon, Swiss cheese, milk and an onion. I walked back.</p>

<p>The timing of the dinner forced me to serve the dish cold. Therefore I gathered the necessary tools and ingredients the night before and meticulously followed the recipe. I preheated to 400 degrees. I fried bacon. I grated cheese. I chopped onion. I beat eggs and milk and salt and pepper and Bisquick. I put it all together in a greased baking dish. I put it in the oven and waited.</p>

<p>Several tens of minutes and a few incredulous instant messages later –</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(19:12:21) Jerry: so what have u been up to?<br />
(19:12:38) William: Working, and working. And cooking a quiche at the moment.<br />
(19:12:43) William: But mostly working.<br />
(19:12:50) Jerry: ur cooking?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– I removed a beautiful quiche from the oven and carefully placed it in the refrigerator. It smelled good.</p>

<p>Today I brought it to church and put it in the fridge there. After church I rode with Marc (the president) to the home of Tamara (the president). We ate dinner and everyone loved the quiche. I was so happy.</p>

<p>The end.</p>
