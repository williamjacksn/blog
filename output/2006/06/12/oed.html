            <h2>The Oxford English Dictionary</h2>

<p>Dear Cherry,</p>

<p>I completed reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006099486X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=006099486X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=subtlcooln-20">The Professor and the Madman</a></em> today. It was an excellent book. It changed the way I think about dictionaries and their use.</p>

<p>First, while I was still reading it, I looked up information about the <a href="http://oed.com/">OED online</a>. I found out that I could subscribe to access the online version for $295 per year. Wow. Then I realized that my university would probably have a subscription already, so I investigated.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I can access the OED online through my universityʼs <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/">library web site</a>. This made me very happy. As in, as long as I am affiliated with the University of Texas, I will never use any other online dictionary again. Ever.</p>

<p>Second, my perception of the purpose of a dictionary has fundamentally changed. I am reminded of <a href="/2006/04/15/new-word">some things I wrote recently</a> regarding ‘florescent’ and ‘fluorescent’, for example. I used to think that it was the dictionaryʼs job to ‘fix’ the language – to define the rules of engagement, as it were. I was under the impression that if one used a word in violation of its stated definition, one used the word incorrectly. Period.</p>

<p>Now I understand: the dictionary is not scripture; it is merely history. While it does its best to accurately describe what a word <em>means</em>, its primary purpose is to accurately describe what a word <em>meant</em>. The dictionary is a book of history. It preserves, as best as possible, the history of a language.</p>

<p>The English language is not set. It is a living, evolving thing. It is not ‘fixed’, and is there any sane way to ‘fix’ it? I submit that there is not.</p>

<p>Lexicographically,</p>

<p>William</p>
