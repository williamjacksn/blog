<p>When I came home from my vacation in Utah and Idaho,
Marco was already a resident in my apartment. Marco is
from Florida.</p>

<p>I have determined that Marco is a <em>Pseudemys floridana
peninsularis</em>, a peninsula cooter. And I think Marco is female.</p>

<p>Some more information: My roommateʼs fiancée recently went
to Florida on business, and Iʼm not sure about the details, but
either she or someone else brought me this turtle.</p>

<p>Marco is about 2-3 inches long. I havenʼt gotten my ruler out yet.</p>

<p>Someone else named her Marco, because she is from Marco Island,
and everyone thought she was a boy because no one knew how
to tell if a turtle is male or female.</p>
