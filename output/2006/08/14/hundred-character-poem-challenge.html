<p><a href="http://homestarrunner.com/underconstruction.html">“Correct me if Iʼm wrong, but are you asking for a challenge?”</a></p>

<p>The challenge is to write a poem that is made up of exactly one hundred
characters. You are only allowed to use letters of the alphabet; no
punctuation or spaces or numbers or anything of that nature.</p>

<p>Ideally, poems should be submitted as ten lines with ten characters on
each line. Neither the deadline nor method of judging has yet been
determined, but extra points will be awarded for rhyme, meter, and
general cleverness.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fyqx8r6453cnkcy/20060814-challenge.pdf">an official entry form</a> if you want to submit your entry
by post or distribute the challenge around you school or place of work.
That would be just plain cool.</p>
