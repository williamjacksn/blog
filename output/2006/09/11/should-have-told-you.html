<p>I should have told you two weeks ago that I saw <em>The Sound of Music</em> on
the big screen.</p>

<p>I should have told you a week ago that I visited my parents over Labor
Day Weekend and had my mother cut all the hair off the top of my head.</p>

<p>I should have told you a few hours ago that when I got out of bed Sunday
morning I did not intend to jump on a trampoline, yet later that day I
found myself doing exactly that. Not only was I jumping on a trampoline,
I was doing it while wearing a suit. It was a glorious day.</p>
