<p>Classes continued normally at the University of Texas yesterday as
another issue of <em>The Daily Texan</em> was released. Many students were
unaware as they perused the newspaper that they were holding a piece of
journalistic literature with a flagrant grammatical error on the cover.</p>

<p>“Student protesters questions attacks” read that dayʼs front-page
headline. This discrepancy was discovered by Computer Science senior
William Jackson.</p>

<p>“I donʼt usually pick up the paper, because I donʼt have a birdcage I
have to keep lined. I got it today because I was planning on doing some
finger-painting later tonight,” Jackson explained. “I donʼt want to get
finger paint all over my carpet.”</p>

<p>Jackson continued, “I wasnʼt even going to read it, but the letters were
so big, the error so blatant, I couldnʼt help but notice.”</p>

<p><em>The Daily Texan</em> has a long history: it was first published in 1900 and
has been serving the University of Texas at Austin since then. Jackson
has had access to the paper since 2000 when he first came to the
University.</p>

<p>“I never really liked the <em>Texan</em>,” Jackson explained. “What are there,
like nine different fonts on the front page alone? It hurts my eyes just
to look at it. As far as the grammar is concerned, this is just the kind
of journalistic quality I have come to expect from this newspaper.”</p>

<p>Jackson recalled another incident that left him questioning the
reliability of the <em>Texan</em>. “I remember another headline from a while
back. It said something like, ‘Montoya says adios, thatʼs Spanish for
goodbye’. Seriously, is that supposed to be funny? Who doesnʼt know that
already?”</p>

<p>In defense of the newspaper, the online edition either did not fall
victim to the same error, or it was promptly changed upon discovery.</p>

<p>“This is a real blow to my school pride.” Jackson concluded. “I thought
there were some tests you had to pass to get accepted to UT. Iʼm
considering applying to be a proofreader for the <em>Texan</em> so I can do my
part to keep this kind of humiliation to a minimum.”</p>
