<p>Tonight I had for-real sushi. Not fake crabmeat sushi from the student
union, the real deal. It was fish and it was not cooked! And it was
delicious!</p>

<p>I actually only ate a bit of fish. Most of my dish was eel, which, I am
told, needs to be cooked.</p>

<p>So, if Iʼm sick tomorrow I will know why.</p>

<p>My friend Jerry and I have developed a tradition for ourselves here in
Austin. Every Friday (almost) we go to a new restaurant for dinner and
have an adventure! After dinner we always go to <a href="http://www.amysicecream.com/">Amyʼs Ice Cream</a>.</p>

<p>Tonightʼs adventure was <a href="http://sushisakeaustin.com/">Sushi Saké</a>. The food is better than the
website.</p>
