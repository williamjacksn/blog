<p>On Friday I sang with the UT Menʼs Chorus, “if that train runs me right, Iʼll be home Saturday night.” As it turns out, I was home <em>Friday</em> night and I rode in a car with my parents.</p>

<p>Saturday morning found us at the temple in Dallas, and in the evening we went to a Halloween party. My younger brother Mark dressed very convincingly as the Grim Reaper, and my youngest brother Matthew jumped around as Mario (but without the mustache). As for me, I threw on a three-piece suit and sang Sinatra and Jiminy Cricket while serving punch. No foolinʼ.</p>

<p>David and Chelsea appeared at the party, too. How did they know where we were? They checked the calendar.</p>

<p>Monday evening, to go back to Austin, I actually did ride a train. I did! I had my first American train experience. Iʼve ridden many trains, but they were always in England. Trains in England are different than the train I rode on Monday.</p>

<p>First, it was huge. It was huge! The train was as tall as a two-story house. Second, the seats, they were like airplane seats, but wider, and with more leg room. Third, well, how many of you have ridden with Amtrak?</p>

<p>So I was pretty excited about riding the train.</p>
