<p>Iʼm interested in forming a League. You know, a community. A community of all my friends, with a very official sounding name that includes the word “League”. Like “League of Justice”, or “League of Awesomeness”, or “League of Me and The Cheat”, but all of those are already taken.</p>

<p>Will you help me think of a good name for a League? Because as soon as we have a League we can have an ice cream social.</p>
