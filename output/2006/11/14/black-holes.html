<p>Iʼm here in my Astronomy lecture learning about black holes. Iʼve been told some interesting things.</p>

<p>There are three things about a black hole that scientists can measure (in theory): mass, spin, and electric charge. And thatʼs it. There is no way to tell anything else about a black hole.</p>

<p>There is no way to tell what a black hole is made of. It could be made of hydrogen and helium that used to be part of a star, or it could be made of ice cream. It could be made of photons that canʼt get away, or it could be made of puppy dogs that donʼt want to leave.</p>

<p>Black holes arenʼt very dangerous, unless you really want a closeup look. For example, if the mass of the Sun were compressed until it formed a black hole, and said black hole were placed at the top of the tower at the University of Texas, I could relocate to Round Rock and I would be just fine. Everything within a three kilometer radius of the hole would, unfortunately, be consumed.</p>

<p>In that case, black holes would be made of students, faculty, staff, statues of Civil War heroes, and Spanish-style architecture.</p>
