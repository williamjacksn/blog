<p><em>Update: WardMap has been replaced with <a href="/2009/07/07/wardmap-resurrected">LDSWardMap</a>, which is a hosted solution that you do not need to install on your own web server.</em></p>

<p>I made an update to my WardMap script, so now we are at 2.2. The
changelog is in the script.</p>

<p>WardMap is a convenient way to plot ward members on a Yahoo! map. See
the demo. The demo uses a fabricated membership directory. Actual
directory information for my ward is restricted to members of my ward.</p>

<strike>As always, the source can be downloaded from /stuff/wardmap.php.</strike>

<p>Please email me if you would like to use WardMap.</p>

<p>An explanation: the ward web sites that the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints hosts for each local congregation include a directory
of members for that congregation. There is an option to download that
directory as a csv (comma separated values) file. The WardMap script
uses that csv file <em>without changes</em> and plots the addresses on a map.</p>

<p>Using this script requires a few things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A Yahoo! Application ID. This is a free ID that allows a programmer
to access Yahoo! web services. Instructions for obtaining this can
be found in the source of the script.</li>
  <li>A web server to host the script, with the particular ability to run
scripts written in PHP.</li>
  <li>To view the map, you need a web browser with support for JavaScript
and Adobe Flash. Any modern browser will do: Internet Explorer,
Firefox, Safari, &amp;c. Flash is free from Adobe ºs website.</li>
</ol>
