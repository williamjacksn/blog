<p>I don ºt know about you, but I had a wonderful evening.</p>

<p>I called up my friend Michelle earlier today to ascertain if she was busy this evening. It was spur-of-the-moment, I admit, but it was only this morning that I discovered that the International Space Station would be visible this evening. I wanted to see it, but I also wanted to share this wonderful experience with someone else so I decided to make a date of it.</p>

<p>It turns out Michelle was free, so she met me at my apartment <em>just in time</em> to see the Space Station pass across the night sky. I was afraid she would miss it, but her timing could not have been closer, for the pass only lasted about one minute, and then it was gone. But we definitely saw it, and hands down it was the coolest thing I have seen orbiting our planet this week.</p>

<p>With that spectacular light show out of the way, we each made a cup of hot chocolate and proceeded to walk around my neighborhood in search of Christmas lights. We found some really good displays, we drank some really good chocolate with real candy canes melted right in, and we even took turns spilling the aforementioned chocolate onto ourselves.</p>

<p>We also had an enjoyable stroll and pleasant conversation. We ended the evening back at my apartment with ice cream cake and looking at photographs. Oh, what fun!</p>
