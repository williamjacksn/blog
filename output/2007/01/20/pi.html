<p>Iʼm sorry it had to come to that, but now that I have your attention, I think only a geek of biblical proportions would find this as interesting as I do.</p>

<p>I discovered today that I have a book in my apartment that contains one of the earliest known approximations of π, the ratio of a circleʼs circumference to its diameter.</p>

<p>Just open up your nearest Old Testament to <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_kgs/7/23#23">1 Kings 7:23</a> and tell me what you see.</p>
