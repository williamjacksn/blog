<p>This movie was made with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie HD</a> on an Apple Mac G5. Total time spent:
less than three hours. iMovie has an incredibly easy learning curve. I
canʼt wait until I own my very own Apple computer.</p>

<p>I started with the picture selection. Most of them, including the screenshot of
my hacked website, I already had on my (now non-hacked) website, so they were
easy to procure. The images I had to generate today were the screen capture of
my non-hacked website – I donʼt know why I didnʼt have one
already – and the screen captures of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>.</p>

<p>The background music was obtained with questionable legality, from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella">Gnutella</a> network. My client of choice is <a href="http://www.shareaza.com/">Shareaza</a> on Microsoft
Windows.</p>

<p>That was a feat of networking skill worth explaining: I logged in to my home
computer using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/remote-desktop-client">Remote Desktop Connection</a>, fired up Shareaza, found a
suitable file, and downloaded it. I then transferred it to my server not two
feet away (via my home network).</p>

<p>After that, I opened <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a> on the Mac, connected to my home server and
copied the file locally. Finally, I dropped it into iTunes, and I then could
access it in iMovie. What a party.</p>

<p>The voiceover was recorded here in the lab with an inexpensive USB headset. I
found out I canʼt improvise to a computer screen, so I typed out
everything I wanted to say, then read it.</p>

<p>Throw it all together, tweak the transitions and volume levels a bit – the
music was loud! – and export it. Set up an account on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, verify my
email address, give it at least one tag (that was annoying), upload it, wait a
few minutes, and here I am.</p>

<p>This was so much fun. I want to make more cheap, cheesy movies.</p>
