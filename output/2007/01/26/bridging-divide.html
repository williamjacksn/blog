<p>Concerning our discussion of the digital divide, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-life-for-network-equipment.html">Google donates networking
equipment</a> where it is needed.</p>

<p>Hardware is important to eliminating the divide. Captain Obvious said so. How
are you going to connect to the network without a network connection?</p>

<p>Education is just as important, though. According to the article linked above,
the hardware is ending up at universities and research institutes. Thatʼs
probably the best place to send it. It will definitely be used there.</p>

<p>But when someone is introduced to the Internet for the first time, they
typically need to be taught how to use it. Like I said, universities get the
hardware and get online, and the people there probably know what to do once they
are online. Hopefully they can use those resources to teach the common folk
whatʼs going down.</p>
