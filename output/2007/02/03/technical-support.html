<p>I work in the technical support field, but I donʼt have to deal with
technical support myself very often. I recently had to, however, when my network
broke.</p>

<p>I was trying to change settings on my router when I ran into some trouble. I
would enable a certain feature, then the interface would reload and the feature
in question would be disabled again. I tried it several times, and the only
reason I could think of for the problem was that my router was broken.</p>

<p>I remembered one of my coworkers telling me that <a href="http://www.belkin.com/us">Belkin</a> products have a
lifetime warranty, so I pulled out the box for the router and sure enough, I
found “Lifetime Warranty” written right on the top, and a 24/7 technical support
number to call. I wasnʼt busy, so I called the number.</p>

<p>At first I had to navigate an automated menu. Thankfully it wasnʼt one of
those voice-recognition jobs that wouldnʼt recognize the Queenʼs
English. I had the model number of my router ready, but I was surprised when the
automated voice asked me to press 1 if my router was this particular model.
Either this is a really popular model, or Belkin has had some problems with it.</p>

<p>I finally got on the line with a live person, “Paula,” with a suspiciously east
Asian accent. Insert complaints about outsourcing technical support and customer
service phone centers here.</p>

<p>Actually, Paula knew what she was doing. She figured out my problem in about
ninety seconds and I was on my way. I felt really stupid. I even got a coupon
code for 25% off my next purchase from the Belkin website.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the coupon code expired three days after the phone call.</p>
