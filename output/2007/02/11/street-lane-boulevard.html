<p>The first time I can recall trying to use a voice-recognition customer service
system over telephone was when I had to activate my installation of Windows XP.
It worked okay, but it only asked questions that required “yes”, “no”, or a
number as the answer.</p>

<p>I was recently waiting for a bus, and I wanted to know how long I would be
waiting. <a href="http://www.capmetro.org/">Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a> has a voice
recognition system that will give bus schedules. You can also tell it where you
are and find out when the next bus will be there.</p>

<p>I gave them a call (the number is on the signs at every bus stop) and began
navigating through the system. For the life of me I couldnʼt get it to
understand that I was standing at the corner of Lamar Blvd. and Braker Ln. It
recognized “lamar”, but then asked me if it was “street, lane or boulevard”. I
never got it to understand that I was saying “boulevard”.</p>

<p>I kept this up for about fifteen minutes and finally hung up when I saw my bus
coming.</p>
