<p>On Tuesday morning, the sports section of <em>The Daily Texan</em> invaded the
front page, claiming territory once the dominion of local non-sports news.</p>

<p>This coup came unexpectedly, though it appears to have been bloodless,
thankfully stemming the tide of “whatʼs black and white and red all over”
jokes.</p>

<p>The front page has long been the exclusive territory of UT Austin-related
stories, occasionally commandeered by national or international news of
general interest.</p>

<p>“Sports is not of general interest,” commented Computer Science senior
William Jackson. “Now if this freshman Damion Jones of which the article
speaks had two heads, <em>that</em> would be of general interest.”</p>

<p>It is not known how long this occupation will last. The presence of too many
statistics and foreign words like “winningest” may produce unrest among the
populace, forcing sports back to section B from whence it came.</p>
