<p>Team Ravenclaw had a strong showing tonight. By the end of the night we were
the only team left with all seven players. But it was long, and tiring, and
we just didnʼt have the game in us this time.</p>

<p>It looks like Iʼve become full-time keeper, too. Which is fine by me. Who
needs all that running around anyway?</p>

<p>Also, might I add, I was so happy that my good friends Rebecca and Elizabeth
joined our team. They were great chasers. And beaters.</p>
