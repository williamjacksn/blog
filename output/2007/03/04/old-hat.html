<p>My life is so immersed in technology that it is difficult to see anything as new
and exciting.</p>

<p>My activity on Facebook has increased recently. And, I have successfully
introduced two of my friends to Facebook. Let me tell you, they have gone crazy.</p>

<p>What I mean is, they took hold of this new service and ran. They jumped in with
both feet and they werenʼt holding their noses. The excitement with which
they began using Facebook was astonishing to me.</p>

<p>The first case: Iʼll call her Rebecca. I was at her apartment and we were
lounging, waiting for something, surfing the web, &amp;c., when I said, “We need to
get you on Facebook.” She responded with a look that probably meant,
“Iʼve heard of that, but I donʼt know if it is something I would
be interested in.” But she was a good sport about it, and she set up an account
and started filling in her profile, and I added her as my friend.</p>

<p>Not ten minutes after her account was created did she receive another friend
request, from her sister, who doesnʼt live in the city. I think this was
the catalyst that sparked her total conversion to Facebook. Even I was impressed
with the speed with which her other friends discovered her profile.</p>

<p>Facebook also recently added the option to specifically view photos that contain
yourself and one other person. She tried to see photos of her and me, but
Facebook only replied, “You and William arenʼt in any photos together.
You guys should hang out more.”</p>

<p>“Weʼd better do what Facebook says,” was her reaction. So we did. Since
then, we bring our cameras to everything we do together, “to document it for
Facebook.”</p>

<p>My second convert was Rachel. I uploaded some pictures to Facebook and tagged
her in one of them. Because she did not already have an account, I had the
option of giving her email address. I did, and she received a link to the photo
and an invitation to create an account.</p>

<p>About thirty minutes after that, there she was on Facebook, with a decked-out
profile. Granted, she uses MySpace, so all this profile business is old hat.</p>

<p>As a result of these two experiences, I have been more active on Facebook. I
once refused to store pictures there, but now I do. But weʼll save that
story for next week.</p>
