<p>I hope you like math. All you need is math, and maybe a bit of patience to work it out, and this riddle is in the bag.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was visiting a friend one evening and remembered that he had three daughters. I asked him how old they were.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The product of their ages is 72,” he answered.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quizzically, I asked, “Is there anything else you can tell me?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yes,” he replied, “the sum of their ages is equal to the number of my house.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I stepped outside to see what the house number was. Upon returning inside, I said to my host, “Iʼm sorry, but I still canʼt figure out their ages.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He responded apologetically, “Iʼm sorry. I forgot to mention that my oldest daughter likes strawberry shortcake.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this information, I was able to determine all of their ages. How old is each daughter?</p>

<p>I could really go for some strawberry shortcake myself right now. In fact, Rebecca and I are planning a trip to <a href="http://www.sweetberryfarm.com/">Sweet Berry Farm</a> very soon, so that strawberry shortcake just might happen.</p>
