<p>My friend had a couch delivered to her apartment. I happened to be present at
the time, just not physically. I was talking with her using an instant messaging
client as the couch was entering her apartment, and she emailed pictures to me
almost immediately after it was placed in her living room. Total time: about
three minutes.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, it would have gone down like this: My friend has a couch
delivered. She takes pictures of it, then doesn ºt finish that particular
roll of film for two weeks. She takes the film to the lab to have it developed,
and returns the following day to pick up the pictures. She writes me a letter
describing the couch and how fond she is of it. She encloses a photograph or two
with the letter and drops it in her mailbox one evening. The postman picks it up
the next day, and it lands in my mailbox three days later. Total time: about
three weeks.</p>
