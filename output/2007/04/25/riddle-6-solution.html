<p>So, <a href="/2007/03/30/riddle-6-weighty-matter">the riddle</a> does have a solution. I have just been too lazy to type it here. In fact, the solution was provided by my friend Noelene just one hour after I posted the riddle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you put 3 coins on each side of the scale, leave two off</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>if they balance, then use your second weighing to compare the two you left off</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>if one of the sets of three is heavier, then compare two of the three coins with your second weighing</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>if they balance, then the third one is your counterfeit. if they [do not], then the heaver one is your counterfeit</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>but really, you should try and spend all eight coins as soon as possible and not worry about which one is fake</p>
</blockquote>
