<p>I have not felt much of a desire to write here at Subtle Coolness in a long time. I thought I had a good thing going with those riddles, but I lost interest in those quicker than I thought I would. Maybe I am just busy with school right now. Maybe I do not care about the World Wide Web anymore.</p>

<p>Maybe I <em>do</em> care about the World Wide Web, but I fancy the time when the network was wild and everything was ugly and CSS did not mean anything.</p>

<p>Maybe I just like the way monospace text looks and I am trying to extrapolate deeper psychological meaning where there is none. Now that I think of it, monospace fonts are easier to hide secret messages in.</p>

<p>I want to write some more poetry.</p>
