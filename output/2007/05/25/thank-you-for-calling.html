<p>In the course of my employment, I occasionally find myself needing to activate a new installation of Windows XP. If the computer in question has a network connection, activation can sometimes be performed over the network. Unfortunately, that rarely works in my situation.</p>

<p>When the activation over the network fails, I get to make a phone call. I have called so many times that I have the number memorized: 1-888-571-2048. This is the Microsoft Product Activation Center.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago I finished a phone call to the Microsoft Product Activation Center. This time, however, is so far and by far the best call I have ever made to India.</p>

<p>Thatʼs right! The Microsoft Product Activation Center is in India. I always suspected this, but today I got it from the proverbial horseʼs mouth. That sounds mean. Rahul is not a horse. He is a very considerate man.</p>

<p>As the call begins, I am greeted by a recording that tells me I should try to activate over the network if I have not already tried (thanks, thatʼs a great idea!), and the average call length is six minutes. Today I brought the average up, because my call lasted 18:55.</p>

<p>About one minute into the call is when I actually start to interact with an automated system. The first question is, “Are you calling to activate Windows XP? Please say ‘yes’ or ‘no’.”</p>

<p>You canʼt fool me.</p>

<p>I learned a long time ago that voice-recognition systems donʼt like me. And I learned a long time ago that at the Microsoft Product Activation Center, ‘1’ means ‘yes’ and ‘2’ means ‘no’. So I pressed ‘1’.</p>

<p>“Are you at your computer with the activation window open?”</p>

<p>“1.”</p>

<p>Eventually I get to give my installation ID, which is a (9 × 6 =) 54 digit number that I can either speak or type using the number pad. Just so you know, with a number that long you can uniquely identify one million billion billion billion billion computers. No one ever said Microsoft wasnʼt optimistic.</p>

<p>Ideally, after I give my installation ID, the recording thinks for a few seconds – eerily, I always thought this pause was more for psychological rather than technical reasons – then gives me a confirmation ID to type in a box in the activation window.</p>

<p>However, that rarely works. The recording apologizes – a computer is apologizing to me; think about <em>that</em> long and hard – and informs me that she canʼt validate my installation ID. Now I get transferred to a customer service representative. This is where the fun begins.</p>

<p>I first noticed todayʼs call was different because of the time I had to wait on hold. I seriously listened to the same poor-quality elevator song at least three times, periodically interrupted by, “We are experiencing higher-than-normal call volumes.” Thanks for the update.</p>

<p>I hope youʼre not bored with my story. Itʼs just getting good.</p>

<p>Finally, Iʼm on the line with a live person. I give Rahul my installation ID, and as he is looking up my confirmation ID, he asks me the questions I have gotten accustomed to:</p>

<p>“Is this software installed on any other computers? Did you buy it separately or did it come pre-installed on the system? What is the make and model of the computer? Where did you buy it?”</p>

<p>(About that last question: because Iʼm working at the Help Desk and never activating Windows on my own computer, I always “bought it online.”)</p>

<p>Rahul seems satisfied with how the interrogation went, and we are just waiting on that elusive confirmation ID. He tells me his system is slower than normal today. (Hey, I have that problem at home, too!)</p>

<p>If youʼve ever talked to me on the phone, you may be well aware that I donʼt mind awkward silence. But Rahul must feel (or have been trained) differently, because after a few seconds of nothing, he tries to strike up a conversation with me to pass the time.</p>

<p>Iʼm surprised. This has never happened before. But Iʼm always willing to try new things.</p>

<p>“Where are you calling from?” he asks.</p>

<p>“Texas.”</p>

<p>“And how is your day?”</p>

<p>“Itʼs rainy,” I reply. I think this is a great time to confirm my suspicions. “Where are you at?”</p>

<p>“Iʼm in India – New Delhi.”</p>

<p>I smile to myself.</p>

<p>“Texas, is that near the coast?” Rahul continues.</p>

<p>“Well, Texas has a coast, but I donʼt live anywhere near it. Do you get monsoon season over there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, itʼs just coming up.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you stay safe,” I say.</p>

<p>A bit more silence. I guess Rahul and I donʼt have much in common.</p>

<p>Iʼm curious, so I ask, “Is there any indication of how long this will take, or do we just have to wait it out?” I was tempted to add, “like a monsoon,” but I resisted.</p>

<p>I must have upset Rahul, because he asked if he could put me on hold again. Oh, alright. I hadnʼt gotten enough of that song, anyway.</p>

<p>About thirty seconds later, Rahul is back with my confirmation ID and we are about to part ways. Would I ever talk to him again?</p>

<p>“It was a pleasure to talk to you, sir,” he said to me. “Thank you for calling Microsoft, and have a nice day.”</p>
