<p>Last Friday Rebecca came to my apartment after work. We went for a walk around my neighborhood. We were almost back to my apartment when I looked down and saw an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Shuffle#Second_generation">iPod Shuffle</a>. I picked it up and put it in my pocket.</p>

<p>Besides a unique serial number, there are no identifying marks on the outside of an iPod Shuffle. I searched for web pages that could help me find an owner knowing only the serial number, but I didnʼt find anything helpful. I decided I wanted to plug the iPod into a computer to see if I could get any more information.</p>

<p>The iPod uses a special cable that I did not have; <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MA694G/A/apple-ipod-shuffle-dock">it costs $29 at the Apple Store</a>. However, I remembered that my supervisor at work has an iPod Shuffle, so I explained my situation to her in an email and asked if I could borrow her cable. She brought it to work on Tuesday.</p>

<p>I plugged the iPod into an available <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> at the Help Desk. The first thing I noticed was the name of the device: “Nathan Woodʼs iPod Shuffle”. Now I had a name.</p>

<p>If there was any music on the iPod that had been purchased from the iTunes Store, I would have been able to find an email address. Unfortunately, all the music was either copied from a CD or obtained in some other way. With nothing to help me but this name, “Nathan Wood”, I turned to the Internet.</p>

<p>Google has an excellent phonebook service, and typing “nathan wood, austin, tx” into the Google search box returned one result in the phonebook. There was a Nathan Wood that lived across the street from me; I had found the iPod right outside his house. I was sure I had found the owner. Now I had an Austin-area telephone number.</p>

<p>I also searched for his name in the UT Austin public directory, and found the same person, but with a different telephone number: this one was from Denver. I assumed this would be a mobile phone, so I called it first.</p>

<p>After four rings, someone answered: “Hello?”</p>

<p>“Hi, is this Nathan?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“My name is William. Iʼm calling about an iPod. Did you lose one?”</p>

<p>“No, I didnʼt lose an iPod.”</p>

<p>Hmm, thatʼs strange. “Alright, thank you very much.”</p>

<p>“Wait, did you find an iPod with this telephone number on it?” Nathan asked.</p>

<p>“No, I found an iPod with a name on it, and I looked up the name in the directory.”</p>

<p>“Oh, okay. Well, I didnʼt lose an iPod.”</p>

<p>“Okay. Have a good day!”</p>

<p>At this point I felt that I had made a good faith effort to locate the owner of the iPod, and I had no other leads to follow, so I consigned myself to the fate that is owning an iPod Shuffle. And I was happy.</p>

<p>But I knew something was funny. And I was right!</p>

<p>Later that night, my phone rang; it was Nathan, calling from that Denver mobile phone. When I had called him earlier that day, he was thinking about his <em>regular</em> iPod, and wasnʼt thinking about his iPod Shuffle.</p>

<p>“Is it one of those tiny, silver iPods with the clip?” he asked.</p>

<p>That was a good enough description for me, so I asked if he was home. He told me he was, and I said I was just across the street and would be there in less than a minute. I went over there, he came out of his house, I handed him his iPod, and went home.</p>

<p>And that is the story of how I found, almost owned, and ultimately returned a lost iPod Shuffle.</p>
