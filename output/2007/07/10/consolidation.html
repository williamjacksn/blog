<p>Until Google releases Socialstream, I will endeavor to collect all my content that I have scattered across the network, and consolidate it here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The blog, for the moment, is <a href="http://blog.subtlecoolness.com/">right here</a>. I am considering moving it to Blogger. But not very seriously.</li>
  <li>
    <strike>Photographs are at [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/subtlecoolness/).</strike>
    <p>My other option was Picasa Web Albums, but I like a lot of the features Flickr has that Picasa does not. Google canʼt be the greatest at everything, friend. I am working on moving over any photos I have left on this site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You will find videos at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/subtlecoolness">YouTube</a>. These are few, but available nevertheless. I suppose I could have used Google Video, but Google owns both sites anyway. Note to self: if you ever get into making videos more seriously, look into <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</li>
  <li>I keep my bookmarks at <a href="http://del.icio.us/subtlecoolness">del.icio.us</a>. I think you should, too. At least, your public ones. If you use del.icio.us, let me know so you can be in my network!</li>
  <li>If you donʼt know my email address, hereʼs a hint: my name is William and my website is subtlecoolness.com. If you are my friend on Facebook, you can get my telephone number and a lot of other contact information from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/subtlecoolness">my profile page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>My master plan is to just fetch everything from those sites and weave it all together here. But all in good time, friend.</p>
