<p>Perhaps you can imagine this scenario:</p>

<p>I am standing at a crosswalk waiting for the Red Hand to be replaced by the Walking Man, waiting alongside two dozen other students. I just got off the bus outside the University Co-op and it is 7:35 in the morning.</p>

<p>The cars begin to thin, as they always do just before the traffic light turns amber. Already several people have stepped off the curb. The light turns amber, and two-thirds of the herd of Longhorns are almost into the first lane of traffic. The light turns red, and everyone but me and one other girl are in the street.</p>

<p>Then, and only then, does the Walking Man appear. Then, and only then, do I step off the curb and cross the street.</p>

<p>Then, and only then (except for right now), do I think about how I must be a member of a secret club of people who wait for the appropriate time to cross the street. Actually, I am probably the president of that club.</p>

<p>Other secret clubs of which I am probably the president include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People Who Dress Up Instead of Dress Down on Friday</li>
  <li>The League of Wearers of Thick-rimmed Glasses (this one is quite large)</li>
</ul>

<p>I was recently kicked out of one secret club: IT Consultants Who Tell You to Back Up Your Data but Do Not Back Up Their Own.</p>
