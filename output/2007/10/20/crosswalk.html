<p>Geoff Yano is my favorite director. I might be a bit biased, because he has directed every film I ever acted in. But he is great! And phenomenal.</p>

<p>Geoff is so phenomenal, in fact, that he recently made a three-minute movie in 24 hours. And it is awesome. The movie, <em>Crosswalk</em>, is part of the 2007 Apple Insomnia Film Festival. Itʼs a contest and normal people like you and like me get to help decide who wins.</p>

<p>So you should click that banner up above and rate Geoffʼs movie, because it is really good and deserves to win.</p>

<p>For more detailed instructions on how to register and rate the film, <a href="http://www.goodevilgenius.org/blog/index.php?/archives/12-Vote-for-Crosswalk-in-the-2007-Insomnia-Film-Contest.html">I refer you to Dan Jonesʼ blog</a>.</p>

<p>Please give Geoff a good rating, then tell everyone you know to do the same!</p>
