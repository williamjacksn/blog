<p>Somewhere deep down inside I want to be a photographer. I始m not sure where the desire came from. Perhaps it was because my dad used to have an awesome old 35mm camera that didn始t automatically focus <em>or</em> advance that he would bring out for every birthday in our house? Maybe it was all the time I spent scanning images from my father始s collection of old slides? Could it be because I read some blogs that talk about photography fairly regularly?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, I probably suck at photography right now. Here is a photo I took:</p>

<p>These are some pipes outside one of the School of Architecture buildings at the University of Texas. I took this with a Nokia 6126. Wait, what? That始s right, I took this picture with my cell phone camera. I guess it looks alright, for a cell phone camera.</p>
