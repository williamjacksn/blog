<p>On Saturday Rebecca and I went to <a href="http://sweetberryfarm.com/">Sweet Berry Farm</a> in Marble Falls, Texas. We got a lift on a hayride to the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/LK4Pa">Texas Maze</a>. This is a huge “hayfield maze” shaped like Texas.</p>

<p>The point of the maze is to go in, find nine points that represent the geographical locations of certain Texas cities, and punch a hole in a card with the hole puncher at each point. If one found every city, one got a free drink when one came out.</p>

<p>We probably spent close to an hour searching for cities, and we came out once to consult the map for a few cities that we couldnʼt find at first. Rebeccaʼs mother Ann called me (probably because Rebecca did not have her phone with her) and asked me where we were.</p>

<p>“We are lost in a giant maze the shape of Texas,” I replied.</p>

<p>With Annʼs well-wishes, we succeeded in the end and Rebecca got her bottle of water and I got my pink lemonade.</p>
