<p>My online creative efforts have been directed elsewhere for some time now. I feel a little sad when I think about what this blog once was, and what it has now become.</p>

<p>But I get over that fairly quickly. On to some announcements:</p>

<p>Most of the news about what is going on recently with my wife and me can be found over at our blog, <a href="http://acciojacksons.subtlecoolness.com/">Accio Jacksons!</a></p>

<p>If you canʼt get enough of food and cooking blogs, you should subscribe to <a href="http://mywifesfoodblog.wordpress.com/">My Wifeʼs Food Blog</a>.</p>

<p>My most recent personal programming project fills my need to be reminded of birthdays in a natural and familiar way: in my feed reader! Check out <a href="http://birthdayfeed.subtlecoolness.com/">birthdayfeed</a> for details.</p>
