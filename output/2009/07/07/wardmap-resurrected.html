<p>Back at the end of 2006, I whipped up a script to help me with my Church duties. I was a membership clerk at the time, and responsible for keeping the membership records accurate.</p>

<p>The Church provides a directory of telephone, address, and email information on the local ward websites, and gives you the option of downloading the directory as  CSV file. WardMap, when I originally wrote it, was meant to parse that CSV file and put markers on a map to indicate the addresses of the members in the ward.</p>

<p>I let it languish for a while, but with my recent personal success of <a href="http://birthdayfeed.subtlecoolness.com/">moving birthdayfeed to Google App Engine</a>, I decided to try the same trick with WardMap.</p>

<p>So now, the webapp formerly known as WardMap, and now re-christened <a href="http://ldswardmap.subtlecoolness.com/">LDSWardMap</a>, is available and hosted on Google App Engine. IÊ¼ll be going through this blog archive to refer old links to the new location.</p>

<p>I find LDSWardMap very useful when I need to visit several members in one go, and I want a rough idea of where I will be going.</p>
