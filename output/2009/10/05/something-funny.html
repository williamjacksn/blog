<p>So, my two-year-old nephew walks up to me with a cell phone in his hand and says, “Want to see something funny?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” I reply.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to spend twenty seconds – seriously, I counted – punching buttons on the phone to bring up this funny thing that he wants to show me. He turns the phone display to me and laughs.</p>

<p>I donʼt know what is funnier: that my two-year-old nephew is trying to show me something funny on a cell phone; that he pushed buttons for twenty seconds to do it; or that the battery in that phone had been dead for a year.</p>
