<p>Replacing the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">hosts</code> file is a great way to block ads and malware while browsing the Internet. An oft-updated malware-blocking <code class="highlighter-rouge">hosts</code> file, along with instructions for how to use it, can be found on <a href="http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm">this great Windows troubleshooting website</a>.</p>

<p>Deploying the doctored <code class="highlighter-rouge">hosts</code> file on a single computer is elementary. Deploying the doctored <code class="highlighter-rouge">hosts</code> file to several hundred managed systems is much more fun and rewarding. It is also rather easy, thanks to Group Policy Preferences. Hereʼs how you do it:</p>

<p>In <strong>Group Policy Management Editor</strong>, browse down to <strong>Computer Configuration\Preferences\Windows Settings\Files</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ta4wevnic9s8g0v/20100308-gpp-files.jpg" alt="Group Policy Preferences: Files" /></p>

<p>Right-click on <strong>Files</strong> and choose <strong>New → File</strong>. Set the <strong>Action</strong> to <strong>Replace</strong> (<strong>Update</strong> does not work, because it will not overwrite a file that already exists; it will only change attributes). Set the <strong>Source file(s)</strong> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">%gptpath%\files\hosts</code> and the <strong>Destination File</strong> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">%systemdir%\drivers\etc\hosts</code>. Check the <strong>Archive Attribute</strong>, but leave everything else unchecked.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4t6cnaxle4mp4vm/20100308-gpp-hosts.jpg" alt="Group Policy Preferences: hosts" /></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">%gptpath%</code> is a magic little variable that resolves to a folder in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SYSVOL</code> where all the settings for this Group Policy Object are saved. In this case, it will resolve to <code class="highlighter-rouge">...\Policies\{gpo-unique-id}\Machine</code>. Inside that folder you should already see two more folders: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Preferences</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Scripts</code>. Create a new folder called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Files</code> and put the hosts file you downloaded from the previously-linked website in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Files</code> folder.</p>

<p>In truth, you can put the source file anywhere, and modify the GPO accordingly, but I put it in this particular folder so I donʼt have to mess with NTFS permissions on the source file. If a computer can read the Group Policy Object, then it will be able to read everything in these folders in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SYSVOL</code>. Unless you go and explicitly change permissions on your source file. Now why would you do a thing like that?</p>

<p>Now save the GPO and test it out. Once you are convinced it works as advertised and doesnʼt mess up your environment, link it wherever you want. Now sleep a little better at night.</p>

<p>Donʼt forget to check the previously-linked website periodically for new versions of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hosts</code> file.</p>
