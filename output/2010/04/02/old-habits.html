<p>When I turned two years old I received a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glo_Worm">Glo Worm</a> as a gift. I just learned today that the Glo Worm was first released the same year I was born, making it a fitting gift indeed.</p>

<p>What went through my mind as I hugged my new friend? Did I ever, in my wildest two-year-old dreams, consider that this very scene would be played out with uncanny similarity a quarter of a century later? Certainly not.</p>

<p>Even the green clothes match rather well. I am sure I felt about as much happiness as a two-year-old could feel when I hugged my little Glo Worm. I know I felt the same way when I held little Emily, too.</p>
