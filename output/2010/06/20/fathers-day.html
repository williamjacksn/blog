<p>Today is my first Fatherʼs Day as a father. Emily recently discovered and fell in love with our slide. Well, I told her it was <em>her</em> slide, because sheʼs the only kid we have. Emily runs this place, did you know?</p>

<p>Also, Emily has not yet slid down the slide. She prefers to use it as more of a <em>seat</em>. But it makes her happy, so I wonʼt rush her into sliding anytime soon. She will continue to thoroughly enjoy <em>sitting</em> on her <em>seat</em>.</p>

<p>Today for Fatherʼs Day, Rebecca gave me a windshield visor and steering wheel cover for my car. The weather gets hot in the summer, you see, when you live in Texas, and I donʼt always have the opportunity to park my car in the shade. I have a hard time driving home from work when my steering wheel is hot enough to cook ground beef on, according to the windshield visor packaging. I could also cook a turkey on the dashboard.</p>

<p>Who needs a grill?</p>
