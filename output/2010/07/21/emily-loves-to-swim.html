<p>Rebecca takes Emily to the pool several times during the week, and we all go as a family in the evenings or on Saturday afternoon. Emily loves being in the water. She seems to have no fear. She crawls around in the shallow end and kicks her legs when we hold her in the deep end.</p>

<p>She also looks super cute in her swimsuit.</p>
