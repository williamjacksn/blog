<p>I had an incredible idea today. Microwaves should have barcode scanners.</p>

<p>Seriously, microwaves should have barcode scanners right on the front. And
microwaveable meals should have barcodes that instruct the microwave how to cook
them. Popcorn, too. The barcode could contain information about how long and at
what power level the food needs to be cooked.</p>

<p>Frozen dinner manufacturers would then have the freedom to be as complicated as
they want with their cooking instructions. High power for 1:15, 70% power for
3:45. With a 30 second pause in the middle. Eating convenience food just got ten
times more convenient. You donʼt even need to know how to read.</p>

<p>Scan package, put food in, press start.</p>

<p>I donʼt know why I am so excited about this. I donʼt even eat
microwave dinners.</p>
