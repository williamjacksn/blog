<p>Youʼre done!</p>

<h3 id="case-study-1">Case Study 1</h3>

<p>The summer before my senior year of high school, I got a job delivering
furniture and appliances for a store in downtown Waco, Texas. The place sold
washers, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers, beds, couches, televisions, and
even lawnmowers. They also fixed cars and sold tires. It was like a small town
version of Sears, I guess.</p>

<p>Anyway, the place was closing for good at the end of the summer, and business
was really slow, and I got to know the sales floor guys fairly well, and one of
them decided to buy a new television from the store where he worked. I guess he
got a good deal from himself? So he asked me if I wanted his old television
(which he happened to bring to work).</p>

<p>It was better than the box we had at home at the time, so I called my dad and he
picked me up from work that afternoon with the car with a big trunk, and we took
home a new (to us) television. I feel like I deserved more cred with the sibs
than I got for that.</p>

<h3 id="case-study-2">Case Study 2</h3>

<p>Rebecca and I got married but we didnʼt have a television and we
didnʼt have plans to buy one. Shortly after Rebecca was called as an
assistant librarian at church, she was there one evening with the main building
librarian. They were replacing the old televisions, which were just going to be
thrown away, and Rebecca asked if we could have it, and suddenly we had a
television!</p>

<p>It was actually quite nice because even though it was from 1995 or so it was
only used at most once a week, so the picture quality was really good.</p>

<p>One of the other librarians got kind of mad when she found out we got a
television and she didnʼt.</p>

<h3 id="case-study-3">Case Study 3</h3>

<p>Rebecca and I moved from our little apartment into a house over a year ago, and
we were still sporting that old ex-church-library television. One of the things
that bugged us a little was that it was so old that it didnʼt support
closed captions. And we had to get one of those digital converter boxes. But we
got along just fine.</p>

<p>Then one day a friend from church started asking around for someone who wanted a
television. They had been given it, but it was too big for their TV stand or
cabinet or whatever. Rebecca jumped at it and they gave it to us. Pros: it was
newer, so it supported closed captions <em>and</em> digital signals. Cons: it weighed
twice as much as me and it broke the cart we had our old television on.</p>

<p>So this new (to us) beast of a television has been sitting on the floor in the
corner of our living room for a few weeks. When we got it we started looking for
a TV stand. Turns out, you canʼt really find a stand for such a heavy
television from places like IKEA anymore. They only make them for flatscreens
these days. Go figure.</p>

<p>So we turned to Craigslist. We looked and looked for days, and saw some we liked
that got sold before we could get to them. We saw several that were just ugly,
but hey, such is the charm of Craigslist.</p>

<p>Rebecca assumed that plenty of people would be trying to sell old televisions
(and TV stands) after Christmas to make room for the new televisions they got,
and boy was she right. We finally found one we liked and snapped it up on New
Yearʼs Day.</p>
