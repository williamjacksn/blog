<p>Among other things, Rebecca gave me a pass to go on a <a href="http://www.chimpsy.com/fieldtrips/">photography field
trip</a> for my birthday. I signed up for this morning ºs session. Nine
students and one instructor met at a coffee shop in east Austin with our
point-and-shoot cameras, ready to learn.</p>

<p>To begin, Joel, our instructor, introduced us to several features on our cameras
and explained how to use them: ISO, exposure compensation, metering, white
balance, &amp;c. Then he gave us some tips on composing photos: the rule of thirds,
creative points-of-view, and perspective lines.</p>

<p>After the instruction, we started walking around and practicing what we learned.
Joel was very helpful when I needed clarification or additional help.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun! I learned a lot and I feel like I have a better idea of how
to take much better pictures. These are just a few of the photos I shot today.</p>

<p>I think this next one will make a good desktop background.</p>

<p>The last one is an old telephone pole with no wires that has been taken over by
the local plant life.</p>
