<p>It has been a while (since mid-February, actually) since I got a GPS navigation
device for my car. This is how I got it.</p>

<p>Sometime near the beginning of the year, I got an advertisement in the mail for
a roadside assistance membership called AutoVantage. According to the flyer, if
I joined I would get a free GPS device and the first month of membership was
free. This offer came through my bank – I have a credit card from Wells Fargo
that I havenʼt used in years.</p>

<p>I thought for a moment that this was a scam, but I decided it must be legitimate
if Wells Fargo was going to put their name on it. I carefully read the fine
print, filled out the forms, and applied. Worst case scenario: I would be out
$15.99 with no GPS device.</p>

<p>Mediocre case scenario: I would end up paying $15.99 for a GPS device that
normally sells for about $45.</p>

<p>Best case scenario: I would get a free GPS device with no strings attached.</p>

<p>I will tell you right now that the best case scenario transpired. I got the GPS
device, I cancelled my membership via email without any trouble, and my credit
card statement the following month had a debit of $15.99 shortly followed by a
credit of $15.99.</p>

<p>Also I donʼt get lost any more when I am trying to get to your house.</p>
