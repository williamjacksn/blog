<p>The early bird gets the worm. / Good things come to those who wait.</p>

<p>Look before you leap. / He who hesitates is lost.</p>

<p>Two heads are better than one. / If you want something done right, do it
yourself.</p>

<p>Nothing ventured, nothing gained. / Better safe than sorry.</p>

<p>Out of sight, out of mind. / Absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>

<p>You canʼt tell a book by its cover. / The clothes make the man.</p>

<p>Many hands make light work. / Too many cooks spoil the broth.</p>

<p>You canʼt teach an old dog new tricks. / Itʼs never too late to
learn.</p>

<p>Never sweat the small stuff. / God is in the details.</p>

<p>If at first you donʼt succeed, try, try again. / Donʼt beat your
head against a brick wall.</p>

<p>Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today. / Donʼt cross the
bridge until you come to it.</p>

<p>More haste less speed. / Time waits for no man.</p>

<p>A word to the wise is sufficient. / Talk is cheap.</p>

<p>Donʼt look a gift horse in the mouth. / Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.</p>

<p>Hitch your wagon to a star. / Donʼt bite off more than you can chew.</p>

<p>The squeaking wheel gets the grease. / Silence is golden.</p>

<p>Birds of a feather flock together. / Opposites attract.</p>

<p>The pen is mightier than the sword. / Actions speak louder than words.</p>
