<p>For our fifth anniversary my wife made me this nativity advent calendar.</p>

<p><a href="http://instagr.am/p/SJWHVKLl62/"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/b7extqrvkcgbk4z/20121117-nativity-calendar.jpg" alt="Anniversary gift from my wife" /></a></p>

<p>The pieces go in the pockets, and each day of December you take a piece out and build the scene. This is just like a calendar we had in my home growing up.</p>

<p>The craftsmanship here is wonderful, and what amazes me the most is that Rebecca was able to keep it a complete secret from me for months while she worked on it. I really had no idea she was doing this.</p>
