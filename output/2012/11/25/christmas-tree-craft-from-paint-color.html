<p>I have spent enough time on <a href="http://pinterest.com/subtlecoolness/">Pinterest</a> that I have started to see crafty
ideas everywhere. I was recently at Loweʼs with my three-year-old
daughter Emily when we walked past the paint department. I decided to pick up a
few color samples in the hopes that I could do something with them that would
entertain Emily for a few minutes.</p>

<p>The Christmas season is upon us, so I asked Emily to pick out a green card and a
red card. It wasnʼt long before I had the idea to make this Christmas
tree. Cut a triangle out of the green card, the shape of a Christmas tree. Use a
hole punch to make ornaments from the red card (or any colored paper you have on
hand). Stick the ornaments to the tree with a drop of glue. To stand it up, cut
a small rectangle from the green card, then cut slits in the rectangle and the
base of the tree. Slide the pieces together to make the stand.</p>

<p>Emily <em>loves</em> using the hole punch and the glue, so she was more than happy to
help put this together.</p>

<p>There are a few variations on this idea you can try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cut identical triangles out of the red and green cards, then punch holes in
the green triangle and paste the entire red triangle behind the green
triangle. The “ornaments” will show through the holes you made in the tree.
This is a lot easier than trying to glue a bunch of tiny ornaments onto a
tree.</li>
  <li>Instead of making a tree stand on the bottom, punch a hole at the top of the
tree and loop through a piece of ribbon or string to turn the Christmas tree
into an ornament itself.</li>
  <li>Make two trees then paste them together back-to-back so it looks nice from
both sides.</li>
</ul>

<p>Itʼs not even December yet and Iʼm already getting into the
Christmas spirit!</p>
