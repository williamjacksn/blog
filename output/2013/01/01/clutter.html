<p>One of my goals for 2013 is to get rid of clutter. I started by throwing away a
bunch of hangers that had been hiding in the back of my daughterʼs closet
for at least a year. If I havenʼt used them for a year, chances are I
wonʼt use them at all.</p>

<p>I also threw out some Xbox controllers I had in my office. I donʼt even
have an Xbox. I havenʼt had one for a long time. I just have this
tendency to hold on to things I believe might be useful someday. I can usually
make a case for anything being useful eventually.</p>
