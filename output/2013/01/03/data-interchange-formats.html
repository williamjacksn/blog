<p>Today while doing some programming work I had the opportunity to take a closer
look at CSV and JSON. My programming experience up to this point has really only
included consuming these formats. Today I wrote code to produce these formats.</p>

<p>We have an application where I work that exports data to a MySQL database. A
while age, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/williamjacksn/fresnel">a very simple web app</a> to make viewing reports from that
data easier. Until today, the reports were only available as tables in an HTML
page.</p>

<p>After the work I did today, the same reports are now available as CSV (to easily
import into spreadsheet apps like Excel and Numbers) and JSON (to easily pass
the data to other external applications).</p>

<p>It was enlightening to learn about the quirks of both formats. I had never
before considered things like what characters need to be escaped in strings and
what character encoding I ought to use.</p>

<p>It seems like whenever I get deep into programming where text input and output
is concerned, I always run into problems with character encodings. I complain
about this to my programming-minded friends often.</p>

<p>I honestly don ºt know what use the JSON output will be, but I was in the
mood so I added it.</p>

<p>I hope to write about my web app in greater detail in the future.</p>
