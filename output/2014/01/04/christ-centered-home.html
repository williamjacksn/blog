<p><em>[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, December 29,
2013.]</em></p>

<p>At the beginning of this month, we hung on the wall a felt advent calendar my
wife made. Each morning in December we take a shepherd, or wise man, or angel,
or other character from the Christmas story out of a pocket and place it in the
scene. As Christmas approaches, the cast of the nativity assembles, culminating
on Christmas morning when a small, felt Christ child is placed in the small,
felt manger.</p>

<p>Last week I took an inventory of our home. Including this advent calendar, I
counted no less than 14 nativity scenes. In each depiction, whether it be felt,
wood, plastic, ceramic, glass, metal, or crystal, there at the center lies the
Christ. What better way to remind us of what our focus should be than to have
depictions of the Savior within our glance almost continually?</p>

<p>Just as each nativity scene is arranged with Christ at the center, we should do
all we can to make the Lord Jesus Christ the center of our homes.</p>

<p>Elder Richard G. Scott, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/for-peace-at-home">said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When [Christ] is the center of your home, there is peace and serenity. There
is a spirit of assurance that pervades the home, and it is felt by all who
dwell there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Book of Mormon, <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26#25">the prophet Nephi wrote</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy
of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may
know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are probably already familiar with a few fundamental principles that help
make the Savior the center of your home, but allow me to draw on some of my own
experiences, both as a child in my parentsʼ home, and as a parent of two
small children. The three principles I would like to talk about are prayer,
scripture study, and family home evening.</p>

<p>The first fundamental principle of a Christ-centered home is prayer. Prophets
have long counseled us to pray daily, both individually and as a family. I
remember praying together with my family when I was a child. No matter what
activities we were involved in or how busy we were, every day began and ended
with family prayer. I learned to pray by listening to and following the examples
of my parents and older siblings.</p>

<p>From my father and mother I learned to pray for each member of the family by
name. When I take the time to think about my wife and each of my children
individually, and ask our Heavenly Father to supply their specific needs, I find
that the Holy Ghost can teach me how best to express Christlike love to them. In
a Christ-centered home, where the Holy Ghost can inspire the hearts of each
family member, we can meet each otherʼs needs.</p>

<p>We have often been taught that we can pray for anything, big or small. One day,
when I was working on a puzzle with Emily, one of my daughters, we discovered
one piece was missing. We searched for a minute but came up empty-handed. As if
this sort of thing that happens every day, my daughter said, “We better say a
prayer so we can find that piece.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation, she said a very simple prayer, asking Heavenly Father to
help us find the missing puzzle piece. After less than a minute of searching,
sure enough, we found the piece.</p>

<p>Then Emily said, “Okay, now we need to say thank you.” Again, without
hesitation, she prayed to Heavenly Father and thanked him for helping us find
the missing puzzle piece. What a humbling example of childlike faith!</p>

<p>We pray to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ. As our prayers become more
heartfelt, by necessity we draw closer to Christ. The first fundamental
principle of a Christ-centered home is prayer.</p>

<p>The second fundamental principle of a Christ-centered home is scripture study.
If Christ is to be the center of our home, surely the words of Christ should be
studied frequently, both individually and as a family. When I was a child, just
as my family ended each day with family prayer, that prayer was preceded by
family scripture study.</p>

<p>My siblings and I learned to read mostly by reading the scriptures. Before I
could read myself, I started by simply repeating the words after one of my
parents.</p>

<p>The language of the scriptures is unlike other things we read, so the younger we
start to read them, the more understandable and comfortable they will be to us
as we grow older. When our first daughter Emily was about six months old we
began reading the Book of Mormon with her. We usually read about five verses a
day. Last night, about three years and ten months after we started, we read the
last few verses of Moroni and finished the book.</p>

<p>One day, about two years after we started this reading, when Emily was two and a
half years old, she declared that it was her turn to read. She took the Book of
Mormon from me, opened it to a page somewhere near the middle, and launched into
one of the most amazing recitations of scripture I have ever heard.</p>

<p>It sounded like she was pulling random scriptural phrases out of her memory and
combining them on the fly. There were also some lines I recognized from Primary
songs scattered throughout her speech. She made liberal use of, “and it came to
pass,” of course. If you werenʼt listening too carefully, you might think
she was reciting an actual verse of scripture.</p>

<p>Even though the words of her performance made no sense when strung together like
that, we recognized that our daughter understand that there was something
different about the scriptures. I pray that this is only the beginning of a
meaningful, personal relationship with the words of Christ.</p>

<p>In my family growing up, we would mostly read through the scriptures linearly
together. But one summer, we studied the Doctrine and Covenants differently. My
father put a list of sections on the wall. Each child could choose a section to
study individually, then make a report to the family about what that section was
about. When a child reported on a section, it was crossed off the list.</p>

<p>We were pragmatic children, so as you can imagine, the shorter sections were
claimed quickly. Even though we were always looking for the easiest way to
complete these assignments, I have specific memories of the Holy Ghost
testifying to my heart that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that through him the
Lord restored his Gospel in these last days. I will be forever thankful that my
parents worked to build a Christ-centered home where I could have these
experiences and where my testimony could grow.</p>

<p>You may recall the story of the Liahona, that curious brass ball that acted as a
compass to Lehi and his family as they travelled through the wilderness. When
they had faith that God would use the Liahona to lead them to a land of promise,
the Liahona led them. After the travellers arrived on this continent and
inherited the land that God promised them, it appears the Liahonaʼs
purpose was fulfilled. But rather than discard it, prophets handed down this
sacred object through the generations until it was cared for by a man named
Alma.</p>

<p>As Alma prepared to pass the Liahona on to his son Helaman, <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.44-45#43">he gave this
counsel</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point
to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give
heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the
promised land. […] For just as surely as this director did bring our
fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of
Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a
far better land of promise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world is full of sorrow, which only seems to increase with each passing day.
If we study the words of Christ and give the scriptures a place in our minds and
hearts, we can build our homes into a promised land today.</p>

<p>The second fundamental principle of a Christ-centered home is scripture study.</p>

<p>The third fundamental principle of a Christ-centered home is family home
evening. The idea of a weekly family home evening was formally announced in</p>
<ol>
  <li>Joseph F. Smith, the President of the Church at that time, called for
families to</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] spend an hour or more together in a devotional way – in the singing of
hymns, songs, prayer, reading of the Scriptures and other good books,
instrumental music, family topics, and specific instructions on the principles
of the Gospel and on the ethical problems of life, as well as the duties and
obligations of children to parents, the home, the Church, society and the
nation. [In James R. Clark, comp, <em>Messages of the First Presidency of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>, 6 vols. (1965–75), 5:89]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This counsel was followed by a promise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the Saints obey this counsel we promise that great blessings will result.
Love at home and obedience to parents will increase. Faith will be developed
in the hearts of the youth of Israel, and they will gain power to combat the
evil influences and temptations which beset them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1970, the Church set aside Monday night as a designated family night, and
asked local wards and stakes to not hold activities on that night. I remember
spending Monday nights with my family. We sang songs, played games, acted out
scripture stories, and took turns giving lessons about the gospel. Sometimes we
didnʼt get along. No family is perfect. But as I recall, we usually
enjoyed ourselves.</p>

<p>We did not only have family home evening when it was convenient. When my brother
Eric and I were in high school, our school choir director announced the
organization of an extra-curricular menʼs chorus that would meet to
rehearse on Monday nights. Eric and I were both singers and wanted to
participate in this new chorus.</p>

<p>We both knew that on Monday nights our place was at home with our family. We
talked to the choir director and asked if it would be alright if we were late to
the weekly rehearsal. He said that would be okay. So each Monday night, after
family home evening, we went to rehearsal.</p>

<p>We never could convince the director to move rehearsal to another night. But
even then, I knew that family home evening came first.</p>

<p>So now I have two young girls, and our family home evenings donʼt always
go as planned. But in the introduction of the <em>Family Home Evening Resource
Book</em> <a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/family-home-evening-resource-book/introduction">it says</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important thing your children will remember is the spirit they feel
in your family home evenings and activities. Be sure that the atmosphere is
one of love, understanding, and enjoyment. It is more important to have a good
time with one another than to get through a lesson.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is encouraging! We definitely have a good time together, and even if we
donʼt think our daughters are paying any attention, we have found that
they get more from the lessons than we think they do.</p>

<p>I have faith that as we make family home evening a priority, our family will be
strengthened and we will draw closer to Christ together. The third fundamental
principle of a Christ-centered home is family home evening.</p>

<p>Remember that building a Christ-centered home will not magically remove trials
from our lives. <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/for-peace-at-home">Elder Scott said</a> that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] living an obedient life, firmly rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ,
provides the greatest assurance for peace and refuge in our homes. There will
still be plenty of challenges or heartaches, but even in the midst of turmoil,
we can enjoy inner peace and profound happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I echo that testimony. We can find joy and love in our homes when we work to put
Christ at the center. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
