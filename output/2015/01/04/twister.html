            <h2>Building a Better Twister Spinner</h2>
<p class="small"><a href="/2015/01/04/twister">&para;</a> 2015-01-04 21:10:00 +0000</p>
<p>I got my wife <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)">Twister</a> for Christmas. While we were playing it on Christmas
morning, she remarked that the spinner was not great. It seemed to land on Left
Foot more than we expected.</p>

<p>My first thought was, “I could write a quick Python script to get a more random
spinner result!” So I grabbed my computer and threw this together in about a
minute:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import random

parts = ['Right Foot', 'Right Hand', 'Left Foot', 'Left Hand']
actions = ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue']
while True:
    input('{} {}'.format(random.choice(parts), random.choice(actions)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is about the bare minimum I could get away with: choose a random body part
and a random color and print the combination. We played this way for a while
before my wife had an amazing idea.</p>

<p>“It would be really great if the computer could just read the spin result out
loud,” she said.</p>

<p>I immediately thought of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/say.1.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">say</code></a>, because my five-year-old daughter loves to
play with <code class="highlighter-rouge">say</code> on the command line and make my computer speak. So another
minute or two later I had modified my script:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import random
import subprocess

parts = ['Right Foot', 'Right Hand', 'Left Foot', 'Left Hand']
actions = ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue']
while True:
    move = '{} {}'.format(random.choice(parts), random.choice(actions))
    subprocess.call(['say', '-v', 'Samantha', '-r', '150', move])
    input(move)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we had nice random spins and the computer calling out the moves. But the
script still required someone to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after each move. The
final tweak was to make it automatically call out moves after a few seconds:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import random
import subprocess
import time

parts = ['Right Foot', 'Right Hand', 'Left Foot', 'Left Hand']
actions = ['Red', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue']
while True:
    move = '{} {}'.format(random.choice(parts), random.choice(actions))
    print(move)
    subprocess.call(['say', '-v', 'Samantha', '-r', '150', move])
    time.sleep(10)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point I was pretty happy with the behavior of my quick little script.
But I took the opportunity anyway to flesh it out a bit and allow command line
options to configure various things. It was a good chance to learn how to use
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/argparse.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">argparse</code></a> module.</p>

<p>The final script is <a href="https://github.com/williamjacksn/twister">on GitHub</a>. It includes command line arguments for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allowing “in the air” as a valid alternative to a color (our version of
Twister had this move on the spinner);</li>
  <li>specifying the number of seconds to wait before automatically spinning
again, or requiring someone to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after each spin; and,</li>
  <li>making the computer speak the spins out loud (only on platforms with the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">say</code> command).</li>
</ul>

<p>This script was a fun little diversion, and now my wife and I can play Twister
without needing a third person to operate the spinner!</p>
