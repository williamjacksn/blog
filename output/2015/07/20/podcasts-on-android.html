<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/07/20/podcasts-iphone">John Gruber linked</a> to <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/07/20/report-82-of-mobile-podcast-listening-happens-on-iphone-mostly-using-apples-podcasts-app/">Benjamin Mayoʼs 9to5Mac analysis</a>
concerning iOSʼs dominance of podcast listening. Mayo writes that most
iOS podcast listeners are using Appleʼs first-party podcast app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly, having the app preinstalled on the system (as of iOS 8) drives a lot
of usage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a big deal. Android – at least on Googleʼs Nexus devices – has
never shipped with a podcast app preinstalled. Google had their own podcast app,
Listen, from 2009 to 2012. <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/giving-you-better-google.html">They discontinued it</a> because there were plenty
of other podcast apps available on the Google Play Store.</p>

<p>(Ironically, podcast subscriptions in the Google Listen app were migrated to
Google Reader. <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">Google shut down Reader</a> less than a year later.)</p>

<p>With the lack of a podcast directory and no first-party app, it is clear that
Google doesnʼt care about podcasts. But if they are serious about the
future of advertising, they would do well to pay attention. Advertising in
podcasts is probably the only kind of advertising that I actually pay attention
to.</p>
