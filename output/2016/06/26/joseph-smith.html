<p><em>[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, June 26, 2016.]</em></p>

<p>When Christ was on the earth he organized a church so that the gospel could be
taught to all nations. He chose certain men as his apostles and gave them
authority to preach the gospel and perform ordinances. Even after his death,
resurrection, and ascension to heaven Jesus Christ directed his church through
visions and revelation to his apostles.</p>

<p>These apostles were prophets. They taught the true doctrine of Christ. Through
revelation they helped to answer questions and clarify misunderstandings about
Christ and his gospel. Above all, they testified of Jesus Christ: that he was
the Son of God; that he died and was resurrected; and that through his atonement
all mankind may saved from sin, become perfect, and live with God again.</p>

<p>When these early apostles died, the authority to lead the church was gone.
Members of the early Church of Jesus Christ could still rely on the Holy Ghost
for personal revelation, but there was no longer a man called by God to direct
the church. Without this revelatory link, many truths of the gospel were lost.
Argument and division splintered the church.</p>

<p>The apostle Paul prophesied of this. Referring to the second coming of Christ,
<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.3#2">he said</a>, “for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away
first”.</p>

<p>The prophet Nephi also foresaw this. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.3-4#2">He said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up,
and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am
the Lordʼs; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lordʼs; and
thus shall every one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord —
And they shall contend one with another; and their priests shall contend one
with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy
Ghost, which giveth utterance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Along with this falling away, ancient prophets also foretold of a restoration.
The apostle Peter <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/3.21#20">called it</a> “the times of restitution of all things, which
God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.”
Isaiah <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14#13">called it</a> “a marvellous work and a wonder”. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.15#14">It was even
prophesied</a> that the Lord would raise up a prophet named Joseph.</p>

<p>And so this is the situation we find the world in. There are many churches, all
claiming to be the Lordʼs church and fighting with one another. The
authority to speak in the name of Jesus Christ and to perform the ordinances of
his gospel is nowhere to be found on the earth.</p>

<p>Through prophecies given anciently, God promised to restore the truths of the
gospel. To do this, God needed a prophet on the earth again. <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith">In the words of
Elder Neil L. Andersen</a>, “Jesus Christ chose a holy man, a righteous man, to
lead the Restoration of the fulness of His gospel. He chose Joseph Smith.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-wilford-woodruff/chapter-2">President Wilford Woodruff taught</a>, “Joseph Smith was kept in the spirit
world for thousands of years to be born in the flesh at the right time, and to
be inspired of God, to be visited by Him, and to be qualified and prepared for
the mission given into his hands.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-brigham-young/chapter-47">Brigham Young likewise testified</a>, “It was decreed in the counsels of
eternity, long before the foundations of the earth were laid, that he, Joseph
Smith, should be the man, in the last dispensation of this world, to bring forth
the word of God to the people, and receive the fulness of the keys and power of
the Priesthood of the Son of God.”</p>

<p>Joseph experienced first-hand the religious confusion of his day. Reflecting on
that time in his life, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.8#7">he wrote</a>, “so great were the confusion and strife
among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as
I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain
conclusion who was right and who was wrong.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, Joseph was raised by righteous parents who taught him the
importance of the scriptures. He studied the Bible on his own. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.12#11">Joseph recalled
this feeling</a> after reading James 1:5: “Never did any passage of scripture
come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It
seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart.”</p>

<p>Joseph had most likely read this scripture before, or heard someone else in his
family read it. When you read the scriptures, do you ever get the feeling that
you are hearing a verse for the very first time, even though you know
youʼve read it before? Pay attention to that feeling. That is the Holy
Ghost telling you that that scripture is important for you at that moment. It
may be an answer to a question that is troubling you, or, like it was for
Joseph, instructions for what to do to obtain an answer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith">Joseph learned</a> that “spiritual questions deserve spiritual answers from
God.”</p>

<p>And so when he was 14 years old, Joseph Smith went to a quiet spot in the forest
near his home to pray for direction. What were you doing when you were 14 years
old? Iʼll tell you what I was doing. I was writing in my journal about
how much I love <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>

<p>What happened in answer to Joseph Smithʼs prayer was the beginning of the
dispensation of the fulness of times. In his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun,
which descended gradually until it fell upon me. […] When the light rested
upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,
standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name
and said, pointing to the other — This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ, visited Joseph Smith. Christ told
Joseph that none of the churches on the earth at that time taught the fulness of
the gospel. None of them had the authority to act in the name of Jesus Christ.
Joseph was promised that the truths of the gospel and the authority to organize
Christʼs true church would be given to him.</p>

<p>Joseph Smithʼs work was just beginning. When he was 17 years old, Joseph
was visited by an angel named Moroni. Joseph learned about an ancient record
that he would later translate by the power of God, The Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>What were you doing when you were 17 years old? Iʼll tell you what I was
doing. I was writing in my journal about being excited to check my email.</p>

<p>As part of his message, the angel <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.33#32">Moroni told Joseph</a> “that [his] name
should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or
that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.” In what way
are you fulfilling this prophecy? Do you speak good or evil of the prophet
Joseph Smith? <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith">Neil L. Andersen said</a>, “Gain a personal witness of the
Prophet Joseph Smith. Let your voice help fulfill Moroniʼs prophetic
words to speak good of the Prophet.”</p>

<p>When he was 21 years old, Joseph received the record that Moroni had told him
about. After some moving around to escape constant persecution, he was 23 years
old when he took about two months to translate a book that is over 500 pages
long. What were you doing when you were 23 years old?  I was in college and I
donʼt think I could even read 500 pages in two months.</p>

<p>While translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph learned much about the gospel of
Jesus Christ. He learned about priesthood authority. He was visited by John the
Baptist, and later by the ancient apostles Peter, James and John. These angelic
visitors conferred on Joseph Smith the priesthood, or the authority to act in
the name of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>When Joseph was 24 years old, now holding the proper authority, he formally
organized the Church of Christ. After hundreds of years, the church that Jesus
Christ himself had organized was now back on earth. And Joseph Smith was the
prophet that Christ had chosen to do this work.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, revelation continued to flow to the church through
the prophet Joseph. He called other men as apostles. He organized missionary
work. He directed the construction of temples and the Lord revealed to him the
temple ordinances such as baptism for the dead and the endowment, and eternal
marriage. Many of the revelations he received were recorded in what is now the
book of Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35.17-18#16">The Lord Jesus Christ said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] I have sent forth the fulness of my gospel by the hand of my servant
Joseph; and in weakness have I blessed him; And I have given unto him the keys
of the mystery of those things which have been sealed, even things which were
from the foundation of the world, and the things which shall come from this
time until the time of my coming […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.22-24#21">Josephʼs testimony</a> of Jesus Christ is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the
testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! For we saw him,
even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he
is the Only Begotten of the Father — That by him, and through him, and of him,
the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons
and daughters unto God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truthfulness of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rests on the
truthfulness of the First Vision and the other revelations the Lord gave to the
Prophet Joseph.</p>

<p>I have a testimony that Joseph Smith was chosen by Jesus Christ to restore the
gospel and organize his church. I know that the authority to lead the church and
speak in the name of Jesus Christ has been conferred through latter-day prophets
in an unbroken line and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is
directed by Jesus Christ through a prophet today.</p>

<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
