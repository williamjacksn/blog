<p><em>[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, May 14, 2017.]</em></p>

<p>We are all here on Earth to follow the plan of salvation and return to live with
our Heavenly Father. We all agreed to come to Earth and knew that when we did,
we would forget about our heavenly home.</p>

<p>God sent prophets to teach us the plan of salvation. We read their words in the
scriptures, and are privileged to live in a time when there are prophets living
on the Earth with us and givings us counsel appropriate for our time.</p>

<p>In addition to this, God has promised us the help of a member of the Godhead,
the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can give us personal counsel appropriate for the
very moment and situation we may find ourself in.</p>

<p>Today I would like to speak about how to seek out, recognize, and act upon the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<h3 id="seek">Seek</h3>

<p>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift">said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we are confirmed, we are given the <em>right</em> to the companionship of the
Holy Ghost, but it is a right that we must continue to earn through obedience
and worthiness. We cannot take this gift for granted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can prepare ourselves to receive the inspiration of the Holy Ghost through
obedience. The apostle Peter taught that God gives the Holy Ghost to those that
obey him. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.14#14">Paul wrote</a> that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elder Wirthlin <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift">also said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I fear that some members of the Lordʼs Church “live far beneath
our privileges” with regard to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Some are
distracted by the things of the world that block out the influence of the Holy
Ghost, preventing them from recognizing spiritual promptings. This is a noisy
and busy world that we live in. Remember that being busy is not necessarily
being spiritual. If we are not careful, the things of this world can crowd out
the things of the Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we wish to seek out the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we may need to make
changes to our environment to make it more conducive to the presence of the
Spirit. Elder Wirthlin <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift">asks</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do we allow influences into our homes that drive the Spirit from our homes?
The type of entertainment that we permit into our homes will certainly have an
impact on the power of the Holy Ghost. Much of the entertainment of the world
is offensive to the Holy Ghost. Surely we should not watch movies or
television shows that are filled with violence, vulgar language, and
immorality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elder Wirthlin also <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift">makes the following suggestions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our homes need to be more Christ-centered. We should spend more time at the
temple and less time in the pursuit of pleasure. We should lower the noise
level in our homes so that the noise of the world will not overpower the
still, small voice of the Holy Ghost. One of our greatest goals as parents
should be to enjoy the power and influence of the Holy Ghost in our homes. We
should pray and study the scriptures. We could sing the hymns of the
Restoration to invite the Holy Ghost into our home. Regular family home
evening will also help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After we have prepared ourselves and prepared our environment to invite the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, the best thing we can do to seek that inspiration
is to pray and ask for it.</p>

<p>The Lord <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14#14">has said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Boyd K. Packer <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/prayer-and-promptings">taught</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learn to pray. Pray often. Pray in your mind, in your heart. Pray on your
knees. Prayer is your personal key to heaven. The lock is on your side of the
veil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Savior <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.63#63">said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye
shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto
you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sincere prayer is how we knock, ask, seek, and draw near unto the Lord.</p>

<h3 id="recognize">Recognize</h3>

<p>As we seek out the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, how do we recognize it when it
comes? I have heard many people, in one way or another express the following
question: If I have a thought to serve someone, how do I know if that thought is
inspired by the Holy Ghost, or if I just came up with it myself?</p>

<p>To that question I offer as answer <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.13#13">the words of Moroni</a> in the Book of
Mormon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually;
wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love
God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that Moroni did not say, “a thing which inviteth to do good <em>might</em>
be inspired of God.” He said, “every thing which inviteth […] to
do good […] <em>is</em> inspired of God.”</p>

<p>You can recognize the inspiration of the Holy Ghost by asking yourself whether
the thought you just had is an invitation to do good. Moroni also said,
“all things which are good cometh of God.” Not some things,
“all things.”</p>

<h3 id="act">Act</h3>

<p>Once we have recognized the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, it becomes our
privilege and duty to act upon the inspiration we receive.</p>

<p>One of the most dramatic and well-known events involving the inspiration of the
Holy Ghost is recorded in the New Testament, in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2">Acts, chapter 2</a>. While
preaching on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Ghost came upon the apostles, and as
they preached, each person heard them speak in their own native language.</p>

<p>After Peter boldly testified of the divinity of Jesus Christ, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37#37">we read</a> that
many in the multitude “were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter
and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?”</p>

<p>Upon recognizing the influence of the Holy Ghost, these people immediately
wanted to know what to do next. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2.38#38">Peterʼs answer</a> was, “Repent,
and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ.” We learn
from the scriptures that about three thousand people were baptized that same
day, acting on the inspiration that they received.</p>

<p>When we recognize the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we should not wait to act
on it. <a href="https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/dearest-children-god-is-near-you">In the words of a hymn</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Children, God delights to teach you<br />
By his Holy Spiritʼs voice.<br />
Quickly heed its holy promptings.<br />
Day by day youʼll then rejoice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We may not always understand the purpose of a prompting, or how a small act of
kindness can make a difference to anyone, but when we quickly act on
inspiration, we show to the Lord that we will do what He wants us to do. If we
do not act, it may make it harder to recognize inspiration in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30#30">For behold</a>, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men
line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and
blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my
counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give
more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken
away even that which they have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>If you feel like it has been a long time since you last recognized the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, do not be discouraged. God is our Father and
loves each of us perfectly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/i-know-my-father-lives">He sent</a> [us] here to earth, by faith to live his plan.<br />
The Spirit whispers this to [us] and tells [us] that [we] can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that as we keep the commandments we make ourselves worthy to receive the
Holy Ghost. I know that as we bulid sacred and holy environments around us, we
invite the Holy Ghost to be close. I know that if we pray sincerely to receiv
inspiration, that inspiration will come.</p>

<p>We are Godʼs angels on Earth. Through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
God instructs us and sends us forth to serve his children, our brothers and
sisters.</p>

<p>I know the Holy Ghost will teach us. He will show us what we need to do so that
all of us, as the family of God, can return to live with our Father in Heaven.</p>

<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
