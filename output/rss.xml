      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, May 14, 2017.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all here on Earth to follow the plan of salvation and return to live with
our Heavenly Father. We all agreed to come to Earth and knew that when we did,
we would forget about our heavenly home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God sent prophets to teach us the plan of salvation. We read their words in the
scriptures, and are privileged to live in a time when there are prophets living
on the Earth with us and givings us counsel appropriate for our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, God has promised us the help of a member of the Godhead,
the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can give us personal counsel appropriate for the
very moment and situation we may find ourself in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to speak about how to seek out, recognize, and act upon the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seek&quot;&gt;Seek&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we are confirmed, we are given the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to the companionship of the
Holy Ghost, but it is a right that we must continue to earn through obedience
and worthiness. We cannot take this gift for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can prepare ourselves to receive the inspiration of the Holy Ghost through
obedience. The apostle Peter taught that God gives the Holy Ghost to those that
obey him. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.14#14&quot;&gt;Paul wrote&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elder Wirthlin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift&quot;&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I fear that some members of the Lordʼs Church “live far beneath
our privileges” with regard to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Some are
distracted by the things of the world that block out the influence of the Holy
Ghost, preventing them from recognizing spiritual promptings. This is a noisy
and busy world that we live in. Remember that being busy is not necessarily
being spiritual. If we are not careful, the things of this world can crowd out
the things of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wish to seek out the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we may need to make
changes to our environment to make it more conducive to the presence of the
Spirit. Elder Wirthlin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do we allow influences into our homes that drive the Spirit from our homes?
The type of entertainment that we permit into our homes will certainly have an
impact on the power of the Holy Ghost. Much of the entertainment of the world
is offensive to the Holy Ghost. Surely we should not watch movies or
television shows that are filled with violence, vulgar language, and
immorality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elder Wirthlin also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2003/04/the-unspeakable-gift&quot;&gt;makes the following suggestions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our homes need to be more Christ-centered. We should spend more time at the
temple and less time in the pursuit of pleasure. We should lower the noise
level in our homes so that the noise of the world will not overpower the
still, small voice of the Holy Ghost. One of our greatest goals as parents
should be to enjoy the power and influence of the Holy Ghost in our homes. We
should pray and study the scriptures. We could sing the hymns of the
Restoration to invite the Holy Ghost into our home. Regular family home
evening will also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have prepared ourselves and prepared our environment to invite the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, the best thing we can do to seek that inspiration
is to pray and ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14#14&quot;&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Boyd K. Packer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/prayer-and-promptings&quot;&gt;taught&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Learn to pray. Pray often. Pray in your mind, in your heart. Pray on your
knees. Prayer is your personal key to heaven. The lock is on your side of the
veil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Savior &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.63#63&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye
shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincere prayer is how we knock, ask, seek, and draw near unto the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognize&quot;&gt;Recognize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we seek out the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, how do we recognize it when it
comes? I have heard many people, in one way or another express the following
question: If I have a thought to serve someone, how do I know if that thought is
inspired by the Holy Ghost, or if I just came up with it myself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that question I offer as answer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.13#13&quot;&gt;the words of Moroni&lt;/a&gt; in the Book of
Mormon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually;
wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love
God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that Moroni did not say, “a thing which inviteth to do good &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;
be inspired of God.” He said, “every thing which inviteth […] to
do good […] &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; inspired of God.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can recognize the inspiration of the Holy Ghost by asking yourself whether
the thought you just had is an invitation to do good. Moroni also said,
“all things which are good cometh of God.” Not some things,
“all things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;act&quot;&gt;Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have recognized the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, it becomes our
privilege and duty to act upon the inspiration we receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most dramatic and well-known events involving the inspiration of the
Holy Ghost is recorded in the New Testament, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2&quot;&gt;Acts, chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;. While
preaching on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Ghost came upon the apostles, and as
they preached, each person heard them speak in their own native language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Peter boldly testified of the divinity of Jesus Christ, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37#37&quot;&gt;we read&lt;/a&gt; that
many in the multitude “were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter
and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon recognizing the influence of the Holy Ghost, these people immediately
wanted to know what to do next. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/2.38#38&quot;&gt;Peterʼs answer&lt;/a&gt; was, “Repent,
and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ.” We learn
from the scriptures that about three thousand people were baptized that same
day, acting on the inspiration that they received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we recognize the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we should not wait to act
on it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/dearest-children-god-is-near-you&quot;&gt;In the words of a hymn&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Children, God delights to teach you&lt;br /&gt;
By his Holy Spiritʼs voice.&lt;br /&gt;
Quickly heed its holy promptings.&lt;br /&gt;
Day by day youʼll then rejoice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may not always understand the purpose of a prompting, or how a small act of
kindness can make a difference to anyone, but when we quickly act on
inspiration, we show to the Lord that we will do what He wants us to do. If we
do not act, it may make it harder to recognize inspiration in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30#30&quot;&gt;For behold&lt;/a&gt;, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men
line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and
blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my
counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give
more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken
away even that which they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel like it has been a long time since you last recognized the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, do not be discouraged. God is our Father and
loves each of us perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/i-know-my-father-lives&quot;&gt;He sent&lt;/a&gt; [us] here to earth, by faith to live his plan.&lt;br /&gt;
The Spirit whispers this to [us] and tells [us] that [we] can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that as we keep the commandments we make ourselves worthy to receive the
Holy Ghost. I know that as we bulid sacred and holy environments around us, we
invite the Holy Ghost to be close. I know that if we pray sincerely to receiv
inspiration, that inspiration will come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are Godʼs angels on Earth. Through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
God instructs us and sends us forth to serve his children, our brothers and
sisters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the Holy Ghost will teach us. He will show us what we need to do so that
all of us, as the family of God, can return to live with our Father in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you use the command line a lot? Do you search for files with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;find(1)&lt;/code&gt;? Do
you send lists of files to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xargs(1)&lt;/code&gt;? Do the files sometimes have names with
spaces, apostrophes, and other special characters in them? Do you think it is
great that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;find -print0&lt;/code&gt; takes care of that when you produce filenames, and
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xargs -0&lt;/code&gt; takes care of that when you consume them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you write your own command line tools?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do your command line tools generate lists of files? Can I send the output of
your tools to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt;, even if the files have names with special characters in
them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You too can separate filenames in the output of your command line tools with a
null character instead of a newline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how I usually do it in Python:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/python3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;argparse&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;argparse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArgumentParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add_argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;-0&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;--print0&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;store_true&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parse_args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;generate_filenames_somehow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\x00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Joseph Smith</title>
      <link>https://blog.subtlecoolness.com/2016/06/26/joseph-smith</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">/2016/06/26/joseph-smith</guid>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 19:00:00 UT</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, June 26, 2016.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Christ was on the earth he organized a church so that the gospel could be
taught to all nations. He chose certain men as his apostles and gave them
authority to preach the gospel and perform ordinances. Even after his death,
resurrection, and ascension to heaven Jesus Christ directed his church through
visions and revelation to his apostles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These apostles were prophets. They taught the true doctrine of Christ. Through
revelation they helped to answer questions and clarify misunderstandings about
Christ and his gospel. Above all, they testified of Jesus Christ: that he was
the Son of God; that he died and was resurrected; and that through his atonement
all mankind may saved from sin, become perfect, and live with God again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these early apostles died, the authority to lead the church was gone.
Members of the early Church of Jesus Christ could still rely on the Holy Ghost
for personal revelation, but there was no longer a man called by God to direct
the church. Without this revelatory link, many truths of the gospel were lost.
Argument and division splintered the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul prophesied of this. Referring to the second coming of Christ,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.3#2&quot;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, “for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away
first”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prophet Nephi also foresaw this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.3-4#2&quot;&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up,
and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am
the Lordʼs; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lordʼs; and
thus shall every one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord —
And they shall contend one with another; and their priests shall contend one
with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy
Ghost, which giveth utterance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this falling away, ancient prophets also foretold of a restoration.
The apostle Peter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/acts/3.21#20&quot;&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “the times of restitution of all things, which
God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.”
Isaiah &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14#13&quot;&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “a marvellous work and a wonder”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.15#14&quot;&gt;It was even
prophesied&lt;/a&gt; that the Lord would raise up a prophet named Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so this is the situation we find the world in. There are many churches, all
claiming to be the Lordʼs church and fighting with one another. The
authority to speak in the name of Jesus Christ and to perform the ordinances of
his gospel is nowhere to be found on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through prophecies given anciently, God promised to restore the truths of the
gospel. To do this, God needed a prophet on the earth again. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith&quot;&gt;In the words of
Elder Neil L. Andersen&lt;/a&gt;, “Jesus Christ chose a holy man, a righteous man, to
lead the Restoration of the fulness of His gospel. He chose Joseph Smith.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-wilford-woodruff/chapter-2&quot;&gt;President Wilford Woodruff taught&lt;/a&gt;, “Joseph Smith was kept in the spirit
world for thousands of years to be born in the flesh at the right time, and to
be inspired of God, to be visited by Him, and to be qualified and prepared for
the mission given into his hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-brigham-young/chapter-47&quot;&gt;Brigham Young likewise testified&lt;/a&gt;, “It was decreed in the counsels of
eternity, long before the foundations of the earth were laid, that he, Joseph
Smith, should be the man, in the last dispensation of this world, to bring forth
the word of God to the people, and receive the fulness of the keys and power of
the Priesthood of the Son of God.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph experienced first-hand the religious confusion of his day. Reflecting on
that time in his life, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.8#7&quot;&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “so great were the confusion and strife
among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as
I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain
conclusion who was right and who was wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Joseph was raised by righteous parents who taught him the
importance of the scriptures. He studied the Bible on his own. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.12#11&quot;&gt;Joseph recalled
this feeling&lt;/a&gt; after reading James 1:5: “Never did any passage of scripture
come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It
seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph had most likely read this scripture before, or heard someone else in his
family read it. When you read the scriptures, do you ever get the feeling that
you are hearing a verse for the very first time, even though you know
youʼve read it before? Pay attention to that feeling. That is the Holy
Ghost telling you that that scripture is important for you at that moment. It
may be an answer to a question that is troubling you, or, like it was for
Joseph, instructions for what to do to obtain an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith&quot;&gt;Joseph learned&lt;/a&gt; that “spiritual questions deserve spiritual answers from
God.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so when he was 14 years old, Joseph Smith went to a quiet spot in the forest
near his home to pray for direction. What were you doing when you were 14 years
old? Iʼll tell you what I was doing. I was writing in my journal about
how much I love &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened in answer to Joseph Smithʼs prayer was the beginning of the
dispensation of the fulness of times. In his own words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun,
which descended gradually until it fell upon me. […] When the light rested
upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,
standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name
and said, pointing to the other — This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ, visited Joseph Smith. Christ told
Joseph that none of the churches on the earth at that time taught the fulness of
the gospel. None of them had the authority to act in the name of Jesus Christ.
Joseph was promised that the truths of the gospel and the authority to organize
Christʼs true church would be given to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph Smithʼs work was just beginning. When he was 17 years old, Joseph
was visited by an angel named Moroni. Joseph learned about an ancient record
that he would later translate by the power of God, The Book of Mormon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What were you doing when you were 17 years old? Iʼll tell you what I was
doing. I was writing in my journal about being excited to check my email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of his message, the angel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.33#32&quot;&gt;Moroni told Joseph&lt;/a&gt; “that [his] name
should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or
that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.” In what way
are you fulfilling this prophecy? Do you speak good or evil of the prophet
Joseph Smith? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith&quot;&gt;Neil L. Andersen said&lt;/a&gt;, “Gain a personal witness of the
Prophet Joseph Smith. Let your voice help fulfill Moroniʼs prophetic
words to speak good of the Prophet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he was 21 years old, Joseph received the record that Moroni had told him
about. After some moving around to escape constant persecution, he was 23 years
old when he took about two months to translate a book that is over 500 pages
long. What were you doing when you were 23 years old?  I was in college and I
donʼt think I could even read 500 pages in two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph learned much about the gospel of
Jesus Christ. He learned about priesthood authority. He was visited by John the
Baptist, and later by the ancient apostles Peter, James and John. These angelic
visitors conferred on Joseph Smith the priesthood, or the authority to act in
the name of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Joseph was 24 years old, now holding the proper authority, he formally
organized the Church of Christ. After hundreds of years, the church that Jesus
Christ himself had organized was now back on earth. And Joseph Smith was the
prophet that Christ had chosen to do this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, revelation continued to flow to the church through
the prophet Joseph. He called other men as apostles. He organized missionary
work. He directed the construction of temples and the Lord revealed to him the
temple ordinances such as baptism for the dead and the endowment, and eternal
marriage. Many of the revelations he received were recorded in what is now the
book of Doctrine and Covenants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35.17-18#16&quot;&gt;The Lord Jesus Christ said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[…] I have sent forth the fulness of my gospel by the hand of my servant
Joseph; and in weakness have I blessed him; And I have given unto him the keys
of the mystery of those things which have been sealed, even things which were
from the foundation of the world, and the things which shall come from this
time until the time of my coming […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.22-24#21&quot;&gt;Josephʼs testimony&lt;/a&gt; of Jesus Christ is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the
testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! For we saw him,
even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he
is the Only Begotten of the Father — That by him, and through him, and of him,
the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons
and daughters unto God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truthfulness of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rests on the
truthfulness of the First Vision and the other revelations the Lord gave to the
Prophet Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a testimony that Joseph Smith was chosen by Jesus Christ to restore the
gospel and organize his church. I know that the authority to lead the church and
speak in the name of Jesus Christ has been conferred through latter-day prophets
in an unbroken line and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is
directed by Jesus Christ through a prophet today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/07/20/podcasts-iphone&quot;&gt;John Gruber linked&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2015/07/20/report-82-of-mobile-podcast-listening-happens-on-iphone-mostly-using-apples-podcasts-app/&quot;&gt;Benjamin Mayoʼs 9to5Mac analysis&lt;/a&gt;
concerning iOSʼs dominance of podcast listening. Mayo writes that most
iOS podcast listeners are using Appleʼs first-party podcast app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clearly, having the app preinstalled on the system (as of iOS 8) drives a lot
of usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal. Android – at least on Googleʼs Nexus devices – has
never shipped with a podcast app preinstalled. Google had their own podcast app,
Listen, from 2009 to 2012. &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/giving-you-better-google.html&quot;&gt;They discontinued it&lt;/a&gt; because there were plenty
of other podcast apps available on the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Ironically, podcast subscriptions in the Google Listen app were migrated to
Google Reader. &lt;a href=&quot;http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html&quot;&gt;Google shut down Reader&lt;/a&gt; less than a year later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the lack of a podcast directory and no first-party app, it is clear that
Google doesnʼt care about podcasts. But if they are serious about the
future of advertising, they would do well to pay attention. Advertising in
podcasts is probably the only kind of advertising that I actually pay attention
to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Follow the Prophet</title>
      <link>https://blog.subtlecoolness.com/2015/06/30/follow-the-prophet</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">/2015/06/30/follow-the-prophet</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 09:00:00 UT</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This is the transcript of a talk I gave in church on Sunday, June 28, 2015.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is our Father and we are his children. His greatest desire is that we, as
His children, grow to become like He is. He has prepared a plan, the Plan of
Happiness, to accomplish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39#38&quot;&gt;this great work&lt;/a&gt;, “to bring to pass the immortality
and eternal life of man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every person in this room, every person in this city, every person who has ever
been born or who will ever be born, made the choice to come to Earth to
participate in this plan. We “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/38.7#6&quot;&gt;sang together&lt;/a&gt;, and all the sons [and
daughters] of God shouted for joy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the fall of Adam, when we are born on Earth we are separated from
God. We also pass through a veil of forgetfulness that blocks our memories of
the premortal existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are separated from God, and we cannot remember what we knew before we were
born, how then can we follow the Plan of Happiness that we were so excited
about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God our Father established a pattern to teach His children on Earth the Plan of
Happiness so that we may return to live with Him. He teaches His plan to a
prophet and gives that prophet the authority to teach others in His name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God has followed this pattern, beginning with Adam, the first man, and
continuing through the ages until we come to His prophet today, Thomas S.
Monson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we know this? The prophets did not just teach the people around them.
They also recorded important revelations, which were handed down through
generations as scripture. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.9-10,12#8&quot;&gt;The scriptures record&lt;/a&gt; the beginning of prophets
on earth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy
concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God,
for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall
have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known unto
their sons and their daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know of many ancient prophets because we have the scriptures before us. Adam,
Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, and others in the Old Testament. Peter,
James, John, Paul, and others in the New Testament. Lehi, Nephi, Jacob, Alma,
Mormon, Moroni, and others in the Book of Mormon. Even our children know these
names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these men were chosen by God, taught the Plan of Salvation, and given
authority to speak in the name of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of the words of Christ recorded in the New Testament, and a
handful of other sacred moments we know of, the majority of what we consider the
“word of God” was delivered through a prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice&quot;&gt;We often sing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Come, listen to a prophetʼs voice,
And hear the word of God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.34-36#33&quot;&gt;The Lord has declared&lt;/a&gt; through modern-day revelation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify
they are of me and not of man;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my
Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it
were by my power you could not have them;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we hear a prophet speak in the name of the Lord, we can testify that we
have heard the voice of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sister Carol F. McConkie, who is currently serving in the Young Women General
Presidency, recently taught us the importance of following the prophet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/live-according-to-the-words-of-the-prophets&quot;&gt;She
said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we choose to live according to the words of the prophets, we are on the
covenant path that leads to eternal perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am familiar with the sad story of a man who chose not to believe the
revelation and counsel given through the prophet. At first, in order to get
along with other members of his family, he did appear to follow the prophet. But
his obedience proved to be only hollow actions. His heart was just not in it,
and he often complained about the inconvenient things the prophet asked him to
do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be familiar with this story, too. The manʼs name was Laman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laman saw the prophet of God as merely a man, and did not recognize the divine
calling and authority given by God to that man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Laman had a brother that faithfully followed the prophet,
doing whatever he was commanded to do. Because Laman did not seek to understand
the ways of the Lord, he developed deep feelings of resentment toward his
righteous brother, Nephi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the legacy Laman left by not following the prophet? He hated his
brother, Nephi, and wanted to kill him. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10.17#16&quot;&gt;He taught his children&lt;/a&gt; to hate the
children of Nephi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And thus [the Lamanites] have taught their children that they should hate [the
Nephites], and that they should murder them, and that they should rob and
plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an
eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One manʼs choice brought hundreds of years of hatred, war, destruction,
and death to generations of his descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/live-according-to-the-words-of-the-prophets&quot;&gt;Sister McConkie continues&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Lord [gives us] the opportunity to choose to believe and obey the words of
the prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We heed prophetic word even when it may seem unreasonable, inconvenient, and
uncomfortable. According to the worldʼs standards, following the prophet may
be unpopular, politically incorrect, or socially unacceptable. But following
the prophet is always right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are to follow the teachings of the living prophet, perhaps I should give
some examples of recent counsel from our prophet today, President Monson. In
General Conference just two months ago, he taught us the importance of
worshipping in the temple. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/blessings-of-the-temple&quot;&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inside this sacred sanctuary, we find beauty and order. There is rest for our
souls and a respite from the cares of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As we attend the temple, there can come to us a dimension of spirituality and
a feeling of peace which will transcend any other feeling which could come
into the human heart. We will grasp the true meaning of the words of the
Savior when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.27#26&quot;&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt;: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.
… Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Such peace can permeate any heart – hearts that are troubled, hearts that are
burdened down with grief, hearts that feel confusion, hearts that plead for
help.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My brothers and sisters, in our lives we will have temptations; we will have
trials and challenges. As we go to the temple, as we remember the covenants we
make there, we will be better able to overcome those temptations and to bear
our trials. In the temple we can find peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Monson also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/ponder-the-path-of-thy-feet&quot;&gt;recently admonished us&lt;/a&gt; to search the scriptures to
learn specifically about the Savior so that we may follow His example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We, with Jesus, can walk the path of obedience. […] We, like Jesus, can walk
the path of service. […] Other instructions given to us by the Savior are at
our fingertips, found in the holy scriptures. […] He instructs us to stand
up bravely for our beliefs, even when we are ridiculed and persecuted. […]
The Saviorʼs example provides a framework for everything that we do, and His
words provide an unfailing guide. His path will take us safely home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are blessed to live in a glorious time, when the words of the prophets, both
ancient and modern, are readily available. We find them in books, in magazines,
on our televisions and computers and phones. Do we recognize and truly
appreciate this great gift? Bishop Gérald Caussé, the First Counselor in the
Presiding Bishopric of the Church, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/is-it-still-wonderful-to-you&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are so many wonders in this world. However, sometimes when we have them
constantly before our eyes, we take them for granted. We look, but we donʼt
really see; we hear, but we donʼt really listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at President Monson, do we really see a prophet of God? When we
hear his words, do we really listen? I pray that we will not take the words of
the prophets for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can know for ourselves that the prophets speak the word of God. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/live-according-to-the-words-of-the-prophets&quot;&gt;Sister
McConkie taught&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we prayerfully read and study sacred prophetic word with faith in Christ,
with real intent, the Holy Ghost will speak truth to our minds and hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, when Thomas S. Monson became the president of the Church, I remember
receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that he was a true prophet of God. I
felt a feeling of peace in my heart and I knew that I should follow his counsel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years have gone by, I have strived to follow the prophet. My family and I
have been blessed for heeding his counsel to hold Family Home Evening regularly,
study the scriptures together, serve others, live within our means, and pray
often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each step of obedience to the words of the Lord as delivered through His
prophet, the Spirit of God has quietly confirmed truth to my heart and mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we sing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/music/text/hymns/come-listen-to-a-prophets-voice&quot;&gt;the hymn&lt;/a&gt;, let us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;heed the words of truth and light&lt;br /&gt;
That flow from fountains pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the prophet speaks, will we be like Laman, or will we be like Nephi? The
choice we make today to follow the prophet or not will affect generations to
come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I testify that God speaks through his prophet, Thomas S. Monson. Jesus Christ is
at the head of this Church, and He directs the work of salvation through
President Monson and those that serve with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I testify that I have heard the voice of the Lord through his prophets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;
